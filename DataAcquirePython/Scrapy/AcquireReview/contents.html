I LOVE this wine opener! It‚Äôs super sleek and durable. It uncorks very quickly and it is easy to use with just one push of a button. It looks great on a bar cart and looks expensive, but it‚Äôs not :)5.0 out of 5 starsWorks great.  Easy to use, uncorks bottle easily and then empties cork. Perfect5.0 out of 5 starsQuick and easy to use. I have recommended it to family & friends5.0 out of 5 starsYes it‚Äôs plastic, 4 AA batteries seems a bit much, but the foil cutter although not the most sturdy, works fine and the corkscrew works just fine as well. All I had to do was hit a button to get the cork out, and press the there side to get the cork out of the cork screw. Definitely worth the $10.00.4.0 out of 5 starsThis wine bottle opener is easy to use and works great. Uses regular AA batteries which are easy to change unlike other units with built in rechargeable batteries which can‚Äôt be changed. After about a year, the rechargeable batteries stop working and the wine opener needs to be replaced.5.0 out of 5 starsI have had mine for 3 years and it's still going strong. I continue to buy more for gifts, at a great price üç∑5.0 out of 5 starsNo more broken corks and straining wine. This works great and I will never use a manual corkscrew again.5.0 out of 5 starsI use it to open wine bottles, quickly & easily with no mess!4.0 out of 5 starsGreat tool to have. Takes a few rounds to get good at using. Apply the corkscrew to center, push down and while holding the bottle, twist it while the corkscrew is moving. When it stops, hold the bottle still and press reverse. The cork comes right out.4.0 out of 5 starsLooks nice enough to leave on counter..!!!I like It!5.0 out of 5 stars
