Very entertaining although the plot was pretty improbable. Very likeable characters and fast paced action. I enjoyed the story and will read more by this author.

The current divisive political rhetoric is absolutely abhorrent to me, so when I read this book, I was happy to see that it addressed the issues in a fictional story.  It seems impossible for an author to anticipate what might arise in politics, but John Hazen's prescient portrayal of the damage that bombastic language can do in our society was fascinating.  Who were the heroes?  Interesting to even imagine that a news reporter might actually team up with the FBI to be more effective than either on their own.  This was a terrific book that is perfect for our uncertain times. It is suspenseful, but in the end, it is uplifting and hopeful.  How can we all learn to live together?  Should we distrust government because of a few bad apples? Having traveled to Israel, it was a pleasure to read the descriptions of the country, and the good heartedness of the people.

Was this even edited?  There are so many spelling errors in this book, it really detracts from what could be a great story.  There are a few areas where it's evident the author changed his mind about how he wanted to write, to the point where certain sentences change meaning.  The plot, while not very believable, is at least developed enough to be entertaining.  Suspend what you know about reality, and just go with it.

Fast paced story. Frightening to think that someone might want to destroy a whole religion and think that it is patriotic.

This one will keep you on your toes and holding your breath as Francine Vega tries to stop either the end of the world or WWIII from occurring. Special Agent Will Allen accompanies her-he is one of the few people who believe the threat is real. There are just too many high officials in a couple of different countries all in on this--can they stop it all--will they survive it.

The twists and turns will keep you reading. This can also be read as a stand alone--although I would suggest you start with the first book in the series! Do as I say--not as I do!! But in any case--read it!!

This is a dangerous book. Are there people who think this way? Fortunately this is a novel, namely a work of fiction. Yet it is also  a story with romance and unpredictable actions. The characters are so well described that one can easily imagine them. Writing style is excellent and filled with suspense. It has more twists and turns and ups and downs than a roller coaster. I could not put it down and highly recommend it.

The TV reporter finds the lottery winner and gets an interview.  He's on the down and out, not what she expected.  And when he said he was going to get revenge for his brother's death, that raised some alarms which she decided to investgate further.  Think hajj, Israelis, 9-11, FBI, TV reporting, WW III, and love.  Love?

The story was acceptable--definitely fiction, not plausible.  The arena that almost had me putting the book away was very, very poor editing.  e.g. words missing in sentences, punctuation missing at the END of several sentences, misspelling of 2-letter words/misuse of 2-letter words.  Even a 3rd grader can write a complete sentence without missing words--and this was frequently.  As well, how can an editor miss an end punctuation at the end of a sentence.  If I hadn't been so interested in the journalism side mixed with FBI, I would have deleted almost instantly. . . .  I really wonder how a writer can call oneself an author with such poor grammar and mechanics--or giving benefit of doubt, why pick such a lousy editor, if used, who can't edit simple sentences with missing words or incomplete punctuation!  I'm being generous to give a 2, but having been a prof of English for many years, this manuscript would flunk on the grammar/punctuation end and require a rewrite for the student to try to gain a passing grade.  Just the lack of punctuation for compound sentences would elicit a flunk in the college classroom where I worked!

A thoroughly enjoyable read. I certainly couldn't put it down wanting to get to the end. It's a feeling of wanting to cheer them on, rooting for them to save the world - which they do.

The plot and characters are plausible and believable. Rogue soldiers who consider themselves as being the guardians of democracy have no concern for lives lost. It's nice to have a story that's a little more sympathetic to Islam.

No Jason Bourne or James Bond style, but still equally effective. You know they'll save the day, but it's the journey that's so gripping and keeps you turning the pages, almost impatient to get to the end.
