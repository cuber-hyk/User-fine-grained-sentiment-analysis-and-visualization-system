    "content": "I recently purchased a 2021 Ford Edge with the new large screen. A few areas on the screen had permanent fingerprint marks due to the previous owner touching the screen in the same spot the anti glare coating wore off, there were also tons of micro scratches. I put a screen protector on and the screen looks brand new, I cannot see any imperfections! Very happy with the results",
