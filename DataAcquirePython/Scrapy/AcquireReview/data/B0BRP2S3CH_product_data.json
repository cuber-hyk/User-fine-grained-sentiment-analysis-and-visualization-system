It takes less than a minute to juice enough for a half a pitcher.  Maybe more but I haven’t tried.  It’s super easy to disassemble and wash.  It is heavy duty and large. I know it will last and is a good investment for my health.",

The scrub brush included is a great bonus. Speed knob helps with produce thats more bulky, but I haven't had a reason to use it passed 50% yet. It tears through everything without a problem. Noise level is not bad, and the material left in the catch bucket is pretty dry compared to other brands. So far I'm happy with this purchase.",

The Juicer is great overall and very fast to create juice when doing watermelon, apples, carrots etc... Although the spin is fast, it does creates foam when it hits the jug, so you would have to let it settle, unless you like the foam.  Overall, very satisfied with the machine and have been using it regularly, clean it is great, very well made and heavy so it doesnt vibrate off your table.  Recommend to purchase if you're in a market for one.",

On top of that, it doesn't extract all the juice from the pulp, it leaves the juice foamy so you will have to strain it through a cheese clothes.",
