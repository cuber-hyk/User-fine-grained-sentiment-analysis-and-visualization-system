It pops my popcorn in three minutes, with about 10 kernels left unpopped. That‚Äôs a very good ratio. I love that I don‚Äôt have to pop my popcorn with oil anymore, making it a healthier snack. (I sprinkle cinnamon on my popcorn and just the tiniest smidgen of salt, so I tell myself it‚Äôs health food, LOL.) Anyway, this thing works like a dream. Perfect for a generous serving for one person (but I suspect for two people you might want two cycles with it). Just buy it, you won‚Äôt regret it. PS-I got the pale aqua color, which is really lovely, but there are lots of other colors as well. Whatever floats your boat!",

I used to get the bags for the microwave and then started to read the ingredients, where the kernels where from and was appalled so started to look for healthy alternatives. First bought nongmo organic popcorn and used a pot on the stove to pop it and it didn't turn out so well.  Then found this glass popper for the microwave which is essentially like using the popcorn bags but now controlling the type of popcorn that I can use. Buy nongmo organic bags of popcorn kernels. I'm super happy with this popper but let me give you some tips for success.",

    "content": "3. Use the high power on  the microwave for 3 minutes. Place the popper in the dead center of the microwave tray, not rotating around the edge. That's very important.  You will then get the kernels popping the fastest and get a good batch. As soon as you hear the first 3 second lag of popping hit the stop button if there's too much time left. Be prepared to expect that some kernels may not be popped. Discard them as they are not reusable but hopefully you get better at guaging the pop level. Popping too long will result in yucky burned popcorn making good popcorn smell and taste bad so better to sacrifice some unpopped kernels for better popcorn.",
