I also put it on as I am priming my face before makeup, let it sink in and dry ( 2 rolls) and the concealer goes on perfectly, no caring, no pulling ect. It last a good night out. Remove your makeup before sleep and put on your night sleep cream and your good to go.  Pretty darn tooting happy with this along with the New application process from the roller to this, you are in control and not wasting anything.  Thumbs up üëç",
