I think I’m going to bing read everything I can get my hands on by this author. There’s never a dull moment as I stay up way past my bedtime reading late into the night. These are the kind of books that leave you wanting more of the character’s lives and relationships. It’s almost like the end of a serious crush when you have the page for ratings suddenly pop up. I nearly groaned when this one plunged into an ending.  Off to Amazon to another Keogh masterpiece. It’s gonna be a long time before it’s lights out for me ……",

We really aren't sure of What We want and all too often when we get exactly what we thought would be our dream come true,  well, it just isn't.  Not everyone loves. Some think possessiveness is love. For some love becomes obsession. Be careful with love. Good reading.",

There was nothing, not even a bathroom break that stopped me from carrying my kindle around all day today to read this. I recently read and reviewed The Mistress and loved it so I thought I would read another by the author and this one was even twistier. I’m not going to go into the synopsis because you can read that on your own and saying anything at all will take away the pure reading pleasure of this book. My mouth is still on the floor as the twists didn’t stop until the end and then still didn’t stop. Do not miss this one. Valerie Keogh is my new favorite author. A million thank you’s to Netgalley and Boldwood Books for the advanced copy and to Valerie Keogh for giving me the biggest book hangover ever!!",
