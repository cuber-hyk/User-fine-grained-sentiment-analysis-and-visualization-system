I need my stuff to do a variety of things not just one. This does it. It's main job right now is breaking up ground meat for the dishes that I eat. I used to use a bamboo stirrer break up the meat. But that meant beating up the meat in the frying pan. That was noisy and was probably damaging to the burner connection on the electric stove. This little gadget does it more gently, quieter, less jarringl, more quickly, and more efficiently than anything else that I've tried. It doesn't melt into my food, is easy to clean, and it can be kept in the utensil drawer. It mashes and breaks apart potatoes and veggies and eggs and strawberries and helps shred meats like beef and pork roasts for tacos and enchiladas,too. It efficiently does the job, it's a very handy utensil to have. It has my recommendation.",

I would be chopping up my ground meat with a spatula and it was taking forever this thing you just kind of like slam it in there pop pop pop pop pop pop and everything crumbles perfectly. I've used it to break up the yolks for deviled eggs I've used it to break up eggs for egg salad I've used it on ground turkey ground pork ground beef I've used it to make potatoes like lumpy mashed potatoes I'm sure that there are endless things that you can use this thing on it is just a really great invention",

    "content": "I am using Hello Fresh and the meals I choose often have ground beef, pork, etc and it tells you to break it up in the pan. Using a spatula, this means a ton of doing rows and columns and still not getting it properly broken into smaller pieces than that. So I happened to see a TikTok with a child-genius cook and he used some tool to help him break up the ground meat. I found this on Amazon and ordered it. It takes very little effort to break up a ton of ground meat into tiny pieces. I love it. My only issue is that some meat clings to it and you have to really make sure all of the meat gets out of it. But I bought it to make my life easier to break up ground meat and it does that perfectly.",

It's not sharp at all which I found hard to use on canned tomatoes.  This just took up space I did not have to store it.  If the bottom was larger or sharper, it might be worth it.  I filed it in the circular file cabinet.",

You just kind of stab stuff, take a break to stir, then stab again. Takes the same amount of time so I guess it’s really just for if you’re having a bad day or not.",
