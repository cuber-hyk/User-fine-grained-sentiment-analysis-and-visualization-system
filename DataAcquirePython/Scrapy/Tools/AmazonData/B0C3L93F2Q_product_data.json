It came down to my android not being a system the newest app version could be used on. I have a galaxy 20FE. I'm not a tech person but just seems like my phone is out of date.

She wanted to label some of the light switches in our house, which after 11 years still has not remembered which switch turns on which lights.  As with everything that comes up as a random need/want, I looked on Amazon and found this one with a decent amount of positive reviews and an under $20 price tag.  I've never owned a label maker, never needed a label maker, but I'll be damned if it's something that will likely get used quite a bit.",

The label designs are done through an application on your smartphone, and there are a LOT of customization options to select from.  I mean A LOT.  Font Style, font size, font placement, spacing, border, etc.  You can use different sized labels, or different colors.  As long as you pick the correct label size, the software manages the spacing and usable space for you.  The printer uses heat etching to create the labels (no ink involved), and the labels simply peel off and stick on whatever you want them to.",

My only con is that the stock pictures on the app are mostly in color and the label maker only prints in black and white.

I wish all their free emojis were in black and white so they'd print the way they are supposed to.",

I shop a lot at one of those big-box-stores and the quantities are a lot for me and my wife so much of it goes into the freezer. Often labeling the baggies is a nightmare because sharpies simply wont write on wet plastic. This machine is the perfect answer. The labels are just the right size, not too big nor too small. They peal easy. They are nearly infinitely adjustable. You can include pictures (line art only)... And the best, for this price it is amazing. I got it yesterday and without reading the instructions, within 20 minutes my cordless phones were labeled, the meat I stored in the last 24 hours and all the coffee in the house. I even labeled my wife but she took it off (go figure). UPDATE, after labeling my portable cordless phones I noticed the labels are not that durable. After using 1 of the phones 5 or 6 times the letters began to fade considerably. It seems my hands were rubbing it off. I relabeled it and cover the label with transparent tape. If you have an item that will be handled it seems you may need to do the same.",
