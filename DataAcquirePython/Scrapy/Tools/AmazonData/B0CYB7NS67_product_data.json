The day it arrived, I made beet and orange juice. Tasted awesome. I have been making juice almost everyday and I can't imagine going back and buying juice from store with all the additives and preservatives. It takes every bit of juice from fruits and vegetables and its very easy to clean. Very good product. I would recommend it to who ever is thinking of buying.",

It‚Äôs very easy to assemble, less than two minutes the machine is ready for processing the juice. Also, with the  larger container capacity , I can add most if whole fruits directly, saving time to cut them. The quality of the juice it processed is amazing , tasty and less pulp. The machine rotates strong and looks very durable. Will keep using it for our daily nutrition intake!",
