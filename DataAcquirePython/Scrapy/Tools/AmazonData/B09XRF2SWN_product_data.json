At first Millie is happy to be living in a small drab room in the attic.  Nina is proving to be hard to please and her young daughter is down right spoiled. Then Andrew her husband seems like the answer to Millie's problems. Then the tables get turned and Millie becomes an answer to Nina's unhappy marriage.Lots of twist to plot that will keep you reading to the satisfying resolution.",

The mushy-gushy stuff was important because it set the scene for the twist. I was not expecting the twist but that is how I often feel about McFadden's books. This one book that I would say give it time, it gets really good halfway through. I am interested in the second book in the series.",
