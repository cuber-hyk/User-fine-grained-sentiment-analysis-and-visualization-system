    "rating": "3.0 out of 5 stars",
    "content": "I bought hardcover & Kindle editions on day of release after seeing Oprah rave about it on CBS. What I appreciate most with Oprah's fiction picks is the selections tend to be a cut above (i.e. more literature) than morning show or other celeb book clubs. (I esp enjoyed Oprah's early picks back in late 90s.) I'm sad to report this was a big miss for me. Having been raised with 4 sisters in blue-collar Chicago, I thought it'd be a slam dunk, but I went from being underwhelmed to disappointed to annoyed. Pains me to write a mediocre review as author likely poured her heart and soul into it, but imo this book needed another year editing and revising, as this just wasn't there yet. A few specifics:",

Neither felt authentic. Felt more as if author was on outside observing or imagining versus having lived it. I can overlook some tells, but the more those slips/omissions/errors add up, the more a reader loses faith in the entire story.",

More development and examples were needed, as parents cannot simply ignore a child--they still need to nurse, feed, cloth and shelter, etc. It's easy to tell but author needed to again SHOW us how cold parents can be there, but not present.",

So when, in college, a strong-willed and optimistic young woman nabs him as a fixer-upper, he's all too happy to obey. I use these words intentionally, because that's how it felt to me. Julia's family is warm and welcoming...except there are some seeds that develop through the story and burst into full toxic bloom. What surprised me was that the once-in-a-lifetime horribleness of William's parents' behavior was actually true as well of people in his new family, and I found that a little unimaginative. The way Julia and Rose, her mother, cut people dead was horrific. The ending was long in coming and not fulsome enough. I admit I skimmed some of the midsection, but I felt like the author was trying to draw out the resolution in a gratuitous way. Miscommunication and failing to speak are my least favorite plot mechanisms, and this book is built on them.",

This read took me longer than most because every page was filled with a reminder of things in my own life. I would read a sentence and start thinking. The themes were so beautifully interwoven and important. I cried a lot and laughed soon after. This reminded me of one of the e epic novels by John Irving. The detail and feelings are so astute. The parallels with‚ÄúLittle Women‚Äù really added another dimension to my enjoyment. I definitely will read this one again. It is such a beautiful story about a beautiful family and their relationships. Bring the tissue.",

    "content": "I did like this book, but I had to put it down several times because it made me sad. I needed to stop reading for a few hours or even a day so that I could gather myself before continuing. I won‚Äôt go into the plot as so many other reviewers already have, but I will say that the characters were richly drawn, and you do eventually care about each and every one. The novel drags a bit, but if you stick with it you‚Äôll discover new and interesting events that hold you to it.  I have to say that the last hour or two of reading will stir up many emotions, and I cried a lot during that time. William‚Äôs character is the one that affected me the most, and I don‚Äôt think too many people will not be affected by him.  Even through the tears and sadness I experienced reading it, I think it‚Äôs worth the read.",
