    "content": "Recently my juicer at home broke so I had to buy a new one.  I came across this product and decided to buy it because it was really pretty.  Typical juicers don't look very pleasing to look at, but this one does.  Even though it is pleasing to the eye, it is a very strong juicer.  I love my new juicer because it blends everything well without having to cut the fruit or vegetables into smaller chunks and the juice comes out like little to no pulp.  This is great for juice lovers like me!",
