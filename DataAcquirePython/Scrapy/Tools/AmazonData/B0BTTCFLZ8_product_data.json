I placed it in the vent. The adhesive option still pending as I fixed the base and waiting for it to adhere to the surface properly because the weather is really hot, I'll wait more than the instructed 24 hours to be on the safe side. With the button at the back I can easily release the phone without having to yank it. You can see on the picture that it's a large phone too.",

So either designate another sub-brand name for each variety, or clearly indicate SLS or not on the package.
