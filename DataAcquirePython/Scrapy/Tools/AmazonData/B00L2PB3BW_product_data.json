And most of them left me horribly orange (with the exception of Isles of Paradise- but it doesn't last long and is very tricky to apply evenly). As a result I turned to the standard beauty industries top sunless tanners filled with drying/aging chemicals and toxins. And even a ton of those turned me crazy orange, streaky or just didn't wear off nicely (patchy).  But like I said, I have a very yellow/golden undertone to my skin so bronzers are amplified much stronger on my skin.  But even still, my skin was just starting for feel icky. So I when I went to order more of my tinted SPF I decided why not give their sunless tanner a try since all the ingredients are things I'd actually want to put on skin. And wow!!! In love!!! And not even kidding, I can get a full two weeks out of one application if I prep right and continue to moisturize! I've even revamped an old tan by adding a tiny bit of this tanning lotions to their regular lotion and used it as a gradual tanner or tanner extender! Not even exaggerating! Prep is key of course!!!! And I don't shave or use any detergents in my shower, so that may help. I wax once or twice a month with natural sugar wax and only use organic African black soap and cowash my hair- so no harsh detergents and perfumes running down my skin in the shower. I truly believe that helps with the condition of my tan. I use the scrubbing mitten the night before (so important not the day of!!!!) to exfoliate and don't get lazy with it- really scrub!!! I wax right after exfoliation if needed while my pores are still open (reduces ingrown hairs and hairs just snapping before the root). Then wait a full 24hrs to let the pores totally close and micro heal. The only prep the day of that is needed is just cleaning the skin with gentle/natural clarifying soap to make sure that there is no oils or residue on the skin. But absolutely no scrubbing the day off, always the night before! I use the application mitt and use the white lotion as a guide of sorts. It will disappear by time your on the other leg/arm- no need to rub it all in! Just use it like a guide. For ankles, knees, wrist, underarms, I flip over mitt to the clean side and gently blend from the adjoining body part down. I do NOT add any more lotion on joints. That will not turn out nearly as natural looking. I wait about 10 minutes then put on loose full coverage PJs and go to bed. The next morning I look amazing!! If I messed up anywhere or see a spot needing blending, showering and gently, gently, gently scrubbing the first morning is the best time. I've had so many compliments on this tan and people being so surprised when they see how pale I actually am without it. Lol",

But after it sat on my skin I noticed what I thought was a funky smell but my husband didn't think it smelled and again he would have told me. But when I did the second layer the next day I couldn't smell it on me afterwards and I have a very sensitive nose so I know I would have smelled it again. This is just my opinion but I think how it smells is due to individual body make up/chemistry and taste. Because I can wear the same perfume as one of my sisters but it for some reason smells different on each one of us and I can love the smell but my sisters hate it and vise versa. So I think that goes with the smell of this tanner. It wasn't a bad smell even when I thought it smelled \"funky\". It was just a smell I wouldn't choose for myself to wear all day everyday. If that makes sense.",
