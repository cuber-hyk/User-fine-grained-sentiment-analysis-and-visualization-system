    "content": "I like the different sections for the different fruits.  The only problem I have with it is hand strength.  It really doesnt take that much to squeeze and get the juice, thats why I like it, but my hands have arthritus since I am older.  But then again its a good hand excercise for me as long as I don't try to squeeze too hard too fast.",

My hands hurt sometimes when I have to juice more than 1 lime or lemon using my manual juicer where I have to press down. Well, I ended up buying this little guy and I have to say I am a very happy customer!!! I am only upset I didn't buy it sooner... it makes juicing SO easy and painless. It comes with instructions and a lifetime warranty too. I love my new juicer. ðŸ¥°",
