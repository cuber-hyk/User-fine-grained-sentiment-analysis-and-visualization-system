    "content": "At first this was sad, but by the end of the first chapter, it hooked me when after she tries to kill herself she discovers, \"There's another place to go, and it's not some mythical after life.\" What if a lot of books, endless books of us, existed on our just making one different choice and it changed everything. What if we crossed a street at a certain time and met the love of your life, but what if you ignored him that day. It's all in here... What if we followed through on our childhood dream but realized it was only to get a parents approval, and you found out, it didn't make a difference anyway because other people aren't controlled by us and their lives and issues would have existed anyway... What if we followed any of the dreams we had of becoming, when we grew up, as a child, if we knew ahead of time what the outcome would be, would we choose another ending, or would we hold on to the life we have because every day we can decide to change just one thing and have a totally different life outcome than the one we have now. This was inspiring, and life changing in how it really made me rethink what I thought I knew.. What if we had made one simple change in our current life and we began to see we matter. Every person we touch, every word we say, every kind thing we do for others all does matter, and may have changed their lives, or saved them. Every day is precious and matters because we're here. In the end, as long as you have any time left, you can still make dreams come true and make it the life you want, or change someone else's life. Life affirming, and deep, this book will make you think, and see your existence matters more than you imagined, because of the lives you touched and may still touch yet. A great read, and a deep dive into our own \"what if\"..then read it again. I promise you'll think about this book for a very long time after you read it. BTW, it has a great unexpected ending.",

    "title": "good but slow",
    "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars",
    "content": "This is an extremely popular book, but it is also a disappointing book. The premise is intriguing, but the execution is lacking. Matt Haig could ask more of his readers and give us a more thoughtful book. We never get much beyond the premise: the midnight library is a personal purgatory/bardo/limbo space between life and death. The space is tailored to the person. For Nora, it is a library staffed by her beloved school librarian. For someone else, it might be a totally different space. In the Midnight Library, Nora is invited to examine her book of regrets and to select from an infinite number of books that contain her alternative lives that result from different choices. Nora ends up in the Midnight Library after a suicide attempt. She does not know yet if the suicide attempt will be successful. The beginning of the book shows us Nora’s unhappy life and then the rest is Nora popping in and out of different possibilities. Nora as the married owner of a country pub, Nora as the international pop star, Nora as the happily married mom, Nora with the live brother, Nora with the dead brother, etc. If you remember the old Quantum Leap television show, entering each life is a bit like that except it is always Nora jumping into another Nora. But like the television show, the root Nora does not know anything about the other Nora’s life. The story is predictable as it leads Nora to realize that many of her regrets were not her fault. Perhaps Nora’s experiences would help a reader realize that he or she is just not that important. For example, Nora’s failure to smile at a customer did not cause her beloved record store to go out of business. This book plays to the modern focus on the individual’s happiness and egotistical self-importance instead of a larger view of a life of purpose, work, love, and service which ironically can lead to more personal happiness or at least contentment. Never fear, there is a happy ending. This book is very readable, and the pages turn fairly quickly. The tension level remains low even when the library is crumbling or when Nora hits a snag in a life. Bottom line: better than some, worse than some. Warning: there are moments of preachiness and attempted suicide is a major feature. I did like this book more than How to Stop Time and if it helps anyone decide not to commit suicide then it is brilliant.",

I began this book & remained open-minded to the initial chapter which began with “Nineteen years before she decided to do die.” Then it flipped to “Twenty-seven hours before she decided to die.” The next chapter began again with “Nine and a half hours before she decided to die.”It was a countdown… 8 hours, 7 hours. This wasn’t a great experience in reading a new book but I continued. I even went back to the beginning to scan the initial beginning to see if I missed something that led to these continuous headlines. The main character Nora in her 30’s lost both her parents, she ended a relationship that was close to marriage, she didn’t pursue dreams she had skills to achieve & to top it off to the current her cat was killed by a car (cats aren’t meant to be outside creatures if they have a home to live in), she was let go from a job she wasn’t even happy at & learned her Brother was in town who never bothered to contact her because their relationship was estranged. She perceived her life as a total loss. One night she took 2 anti-depressant pills & looked at the rest of the pills in the bottle & finished off a bottle of wine. She then decided to write a letter addressed to “Dear Whoever.” The clock struck midnight & the reader was left to believe Nora ended her life & where could this book possibly go now? Where did it go? Time stood still & she found herself in a library encountering her old school librarian who ultimately handed her a book. This book was filled with all of Nora’s life choices & ultimate regrets & what could have happened if she made a different choice. At this point I stopped reading. I, myself, regretted the time I invested reading this garbage. The author totally dismisses the severity of depression & took suicide with stride instead of the seriousness of it. With the way this book is written it leads the reader to believe that once you end your life there is a time between actual life & death to examine what went wrong with the opportunity to go back & change things. This isn’t reality & I find it disturbing this was a top selling book with an enormous amount of high ratings. In managing to get through the initial chapters how could people do it to actually get to the thick of the book which from reading from other reviews, is loved the most. The opportunity to look at your life, the choices made & the what ifs. More people are diagnosed with a mental health disorder currently & suicide rates are at their highest ever. To write a book of this nature is again disturbing. For so many people to have been moved & touched after reading this book is disturbing. I seriously can’t believe an author wrote a book that began the way it did. To get to the thick of the book, to have a main character find themselves in a library to learn about their life could have been written differently. For someone who suffers from depression and has contemplated suicide this book could be disastrous. For anyone who doesn’t but is familiar with mental health, it would be obvious this book wouldn’t be a could pick for them. It’s an utter shame this book is a top seller. It shows what is wrong with society & how people still are ignorant to the seriousness of mental health disorders & suicide. I don’t recommend this book period. I contacted Amazon for a refund & immediately deleted it from my Kindle library. Inappropriate with so many other words I could write to describe what a piece of garbage this book is.",

Please seek professional help, as this book is not going to provide you with a clinical game plan on how to manage your depression or make you non-suicidal. It is a feel good book to lift your spirits, and give you hope (see attachment). Additionally, suicide and depressions looks different to different people!!! Please don't read this fictional book thinking it's going to perfectly describe how depression and suicide looks/feels like for every single person on this planet.",

I like how there wasn't much descriptive language (hair color, eye color, skin tone, etc) because suicide and depression isn't exclusive to just one 'look'.",

    "content": "Throughout this novel, Nora is allowed to essentially live a regret (ie what would have happened if I stuck with swimming, became a pop star, traveled/live x, married x), and would come back to the library when she felt disappointed in that 'life'. The whole point of this was to broadcast how we thinking doing x would led us to live a perfect happy life, when perfect life is impossible. Even when you get everything you want, there are still going to be negatives. I know I get caught up thinking about how my life would have been perfect if I did or said xy&z, when in reality, it probably wouldn't have been as perfect as I thought it would be. In these alternative lives were she got what she wanted, she realizes all the sacrifices that she had to make or give up that she didn't think she would, and how everything wasn't sunshine and rainbows like she thought it was going to be.",

I often overlook the everyday small and mundane things I do, and feel like I don't always make a huge difference (esp. with quarantine). In the book, it shows how her teaching piano for an hour with one student has a bigger impact on his life than she thought. For me, I felt it highlighted how things would have obviously been different if she made different decisions, but the life she was living wasn't as worthless as she thought, and it was something worth fighting for.",

Some of the other girls thought it was cheesy and predictable, without much substance behind the message of \"there is no perfect path in life.\" I agree that it was a little predictable, but I found it overall imaginative and heartfelt. Be warned that there are some heavier themes such as loss and illness, but it has a happy ending. Overall I'm glad I read it!",

The hotel (and its wacko staff) make for a good setting too, though I started to lose track of who was who as the name count rose. This is primarily a who dunnit mystery, not science fiction, and that's why my interest lagged. Toward the end, vast plot holes appeared and without any real science to back it up, the ending felt more of a fantasy. Still, it was a pretty good read.",
