    "content": "That's the worst thing about this.  It's longer than it needs to be.  Twists and reveals are interesting, but too slow in occurring.  Information gets repeated a few times like we've likely forgotten it and some of it was easily overlooked, but I tried to read this as quickly as I could so those details hadn't escaped me.  Staying more focused on the central story rather than building up all the sidestories would have eliminated the need to repeat and retread elements of the story.",

    "content": "The mid aspects of the story are its intent.  It does well as commentary for and against the true crime community and obsessive nature of media for stories like this.  The glorification, villainization and tokenization of victims based on the seeming whims of certain opinions or trends is fascinating to study, but not really the focus of this story.  I think, for that reason, it's actually a pretty neutral story and wants to just show both sides without firmly aligning with or against true crime enthusiasts.  Rather it wants all attention on the idea of justice with or without the courts.  The clearer commentary is on how some are able to skirt justice through wealth, power and/or influence.  I liked how the book handled that. A little vigilante action is always somewhat cathartic, but the buildup was longer and more involved than necessary.  Arguments can be made for and against all the elements that were woven in.  All the pieces did have a place and it all fit into the picture that the author wanted to present, but the puzzle would have been just as effective with 500 pieces as 1000.",
