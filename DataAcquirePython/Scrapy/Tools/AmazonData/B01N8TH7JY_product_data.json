The larger ones fit my fairly large birdcage. I one instead of paper. I simply roll it up to take it carefully out of the cage, rotate it with the clean 2nd one, empty this one in the trash can, and put it in the shower to wash and dry it. Cleaning the bird cage was never this easy before... It doesn't fit the birdcage perfectly, so I bought the size that fits the width, with the length too long. That way it covers the bottom of the cage completely, and it's okay if it runs up each side by a couple of inches; no biggy. These are great. I am glad I have all 4 of them.",

That said, I LOVE it for how I am using it! I wanted something to protect the surface of my desk when I wanted to do my nails. After looking at hard, cafeteria-style trays, I realized silicone would be much easier for storage/cleaning/etc. I found some mats without edges/ridges, but I really wanted a tray with a lip or edge to catch any spills. This silicone tray rolls up and lays flat very easily. It is closer to a silicone baking sheet in stiffness than what one might expect from silicone in this shape/size.",

I have no need to pick up the tray when it is full of objects/tools, and it would not be possible given its floppy (not flimsy) nature. However, once cleared of the larger objects, picking up the tray with dirty brushes and tools that need to be cleaned and any spilled polishes/powders/etc is very easy, like taking a placemat to the sink to dispose of the crumbs - easy peasy. After cleaning the tray I lay a little clean towel over it to air dry the cleaned implements and tools on. Then, it gets rolled up and stored away with all my other nail supplies - fits right into my polish tote bag.",

It's the perfect size for the water fountain and leaves plenty of room for any water that pools. The cats aren't bothered by the mat at all and the little paw print on the one corner is super cute!",

For my friend, who feeds their cats outside, this tray helps keeps the occasional ant invasion at bay.  You do have to remove all the cat food dishes etc to pick up, dump any crumbs and wash, but it seems to hold up well and doesn't stain (I give my cats pumpkin for their overall gut health and it can stain)  I bought one of the larger ones to go under the litter box and help contain the stray litter. Overall i recommend. I can see other uses, as some reviewers have used in their kitchen for a coffee tray mat and so forth. Versatile and nice colors too. I got the battleship grey for the litter box and a soft pale grey-green (i forget the color name) for the food trays. Note that some colors are pricier than the others - i got the lower priced neutral colors.",
