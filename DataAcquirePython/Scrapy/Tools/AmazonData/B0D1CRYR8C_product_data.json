The maximum HxWxD dimensions are similar between the two but the midsection of the G502 is narrower, as in your thumb and opposing pinky sit closer together on the G502 lending it to a more natural claw or fingertip grip. The wider midsection of the Kone lends to a more natural palm grip. This isn't to say you can't use whatever grip you want, just that is what my hand feels just by resting it on each mouse. In use I consider both comfortable.",

Sure, if you use the shift feature on the Kone that changes things up, but it doesn't negate that there are still two more physical buttons on the G502. I will say I was worried about the placement of the 'shift' button on the Kone and it being accidentally pressed, but it's actually fine. There's enough space for my thumb to rest that I can roll it down to hit the shift button or up to hit one of the two upper buttons and it doesn't feel weird.",

I have been a longtime user of Logitech Gaming Software and while it had its flaws and quirks, it largely did as I asked and was simple in its use. Moving to the G502X Lightspeed I was forced to migrate to G Hub and... I hate it. G Hub is a step back in simplicity and usefulness and its only redeeming qualities are that it looks slick and has a subjectively more modernized name. Swarm II feels more fluid and sensical in its UI and thus far, has does everything I needed with ease, especially auto switching of profiles when launching games.",

    "content": "I've been a Logitech fan (especially the g500 line) for a long time, but got tired of replacing them every few years when their clickers die, so I got this Kone II Air to try something new. This thing is probably the widest mouse I've ever seen. It required adjusting my grip (ring finger on top instead of to the side), but it's not uncomfortable. Tracking is great, buttons feel good. DPI adjustability is good. The non-free spin mode on the wheel is just a little bit looser than the G502 Hero, which is good, as I find it a bit too tight on the Logitech, while the free spin on the Kone is a little slower, but still plenty fast enough. I like the placement of the Kone II Easy Shift more than the equavalent on the G502 Hero. I love that it has both 2.4 GHz and Bluetooth options, as I use both, depending on the circumstance.",

Lots of button options that I dont have on my Logi gaming mouse and I like having the options for more mouse actions (always want one more in shooters!)  The 3d mouse wheel gives you extra and so does the lower mouse thumb button. The mouse is smooth (once you remove the stickies) and feels great to me. Nice look and lighting on this thing too which is great. No lag or anything and the performance of tracking and buttons are great. The size of the mouse is a little on the larger size so consider that when buying as it might fit medium to large handed people better.. or at least whatever your preference is consider it.  Another thing I love is the mouse wheel toggle mode where you can switch between clicky and smooth scrolling.  My logi wireless has that and I miss that on my other gaming mouse.",

The Titan Optical switches would sometimes feel dull, uneven, or pop loudly. It would often take multiple copies to get a good one. Sadly, the Burst II Air is no different. My left click feels great, but my right click has a bunch of pre and post travel, and makes a loud popping sound when actuated. The rear side button is also a bit mushy, with a ton of pre and post travel. The forward side button feels fine, though. I do appreciate the DPI button location as I cannot press it unintentionally, but it is still functional if needed. Like the prior Burst Pro Air, this has 2.4 using the USB dongle and Bluetooth. It has only one small LED light, which is fine with me. The software is easy to use and does not feel bloated. I just wish Roccat (now Turtle Beach) would bin their optical switches to make them feel more even, and not pop so loudly. The weight of this mouse is great, as is the shape, but the iffy switch quality makes me hesitant to fully recommend it.",

    "rating": "3.0 out of 5 stars",
    "content": "Roccat was bought out by Turtle beach several years ago and now the brand has been shuttered, with Turtle Beach branding taking over all of their previous products. The Burst II Air is a sort of refresh of the Burst mouse that previously existed and while a fine product with good build quality, I can't help but be disappointed. The coating is fine but not the best that I've seen and the multiple connection options is a nice feature. Feet are adequate, being pure virgin PTFE and glide well enough. No issues with the sensor either, it performs well with no spinouts. But it just isn't competitive in the mouse market at this price. No high polling rate option, the plastic itself while well built, doesn't feel very premium and just feels lacking especially when you compare it to something like the Deathadder V3 Hyperspeed where it has a superior coating, high polling rate option and larger sized feet all for the same price. It just feels like Roccat/Turtle Beach are out of date in the market and not keeping pace with all the other competitors and it can't help me feeling disappointed. This isn't a bad mouse by any means but for the price, there are far far better options out there.",

It does go into sleep mode when not being used, but is quick to wake up when moved.  It also has a power switch to choose between off, wireless dongle or bluetooth.  It glides smoothly and comes with extra slider pads as well as grip tape that can be used.",

    "content": "I have been using the Burst Air II mouse for the last few weeks, and it has exceeded my expectations and my last gaming mouse. From the moment I started using it, I could feel the difference. At just 47 grams, this mouse is lightweight and ergonomic. The solid shell feels sturdy, and the included grip tape can be used to help maintain constant hold of the mouse during fast-paced gaming sessions. It is also extremely precise, and the DPI setting can be changed with the push of the side button. The scroll wheel is notched and has a good tactile feel. The buttons also have a nice click to them, and while using the mouse in wireless 2.4 GHz through the dongle, I have not experienced any noticeable lag or latency. The mouse can also connect in Bluetooth mode and works well; again, I did not experience any noticeable latency. When it comes to the battery life is also nice and long as it lasts approximately thirty-five to forty hours in 2.4 GHz mode. The skates also allow for nice and smooth glides across my mouse pad. Overall, this is a great gaming mouse that is built well, feels awesome, and can compete.",

I couldn't find any way to turn off any of the 5 default dpi settings, so the fact that I only want 2 means I'll have to constantly cycle the whole group. Lastly I couldn't find any way to save the profile to hardware, so the customization is useless unless I want the program running at all times.",
