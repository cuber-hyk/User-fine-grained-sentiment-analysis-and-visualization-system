We noticed it was coming from the on/off area, and didn't stop or change when temperature was raised or lowered, or time extended. We spoke with the manufacturer and they stated that this should eventually go away, but it never has. Nonetheless, it doesn't seem to cause any issues, but we wanted to point it out that it does do this, when most others don't.",

You will get about 3 apples sliced thin in here, not using the bottom shelf (there's some debate on using the bottom shelf). That will shrink to fill a standard size sandwich ziplock bag. Some have complained about the noise. I am not bothered by it. It's low, and steady. If I was in a small apartment, or if placed close to a bedroom maybe it would be an issue for me. Easy to clean and setup. My 5 year old loves helping, and it's very easy for him to use as well. Also the instructions are very, very helpful.

I have now made chicken jerky treats 3 different times and she loves them.  For anyone interested, I slice 3 lbs chicken breasts into thin narrow slices, add a pinch of salt.  I lay the pieces as flat at I can on the trays, close but not touching. Run the NutriChef for 7-8 hours on Max speed, switching the trays around after several hours.  I certainly recommend the NutriChef dehydrator for this purpose.",

They were so nice, didn't even need a picture this time, just sent me another tray. All of this took about a week. After I finally got working trays, I love this little machine. (To be honest, I used it with the other 4 trays while I was waiting for the one unbroken one.) It's not a giant dehydrator, but for my home garden, it's perfect. I dried tomatoes, pears, apples, peppers, onions, and beans for shelling. They all came out perfectly. I've got big plans for next year...And I'm grateful that the seller was so prompt with what could have been a less-than-satisfactory situation.",

Iâm in hope that NutriChef May see this review and get in touch with me about a replacing the tray.  Other than this the unit is so far fantastic and easy to use and clean.  The clip had to be broken upon packing as it was on the very bottom tray.  Thank you for a great product all in all.",

I wanted to try it out on a few things before I gave my review. I did strawberries, blueberries, pineapple, mixed veggies (frzn), Stringbeans(frzn), and apples. All came out woderfully. I am very impressed. I will say, if you purchase the silicone rack covers that dont have the hole already cut out, make sure you make the hole large enough. I was wondering why the food wouldnt dry, and the 1st. Batch took me 24hrs. But it wasn't the fault of the machine. I cut the holes bigger in the liners, and it works perfect. Also, it works even better for larger items like apple slices, without the liners. Im so glad I didnt psy twice or three times as much, to get the same tesults. I may purchase another. Thanks for a great, and yet inexpensive product. Love it!!!!",

Season your jerky, lay strips on racks, cover and press on.  8 hours later I had perfect beef jerky at a tenth of the cost of buying it.  Too, we're on a paleo diet so I was able to make paleo jerky (no soy sauce or sugar added).  Paleo jerky is twice as costly as regular jerky so we saved even more.  If you're worried about the durability of your dehydrator, I suggest buying the 4 year protection plan just in case.  The plan is super cheap.",

The fruit does great but Iâve not had success with the meat (chicken) but thatâs just probably me. The recipe in the book states that you need to cook the meat before dehydrating it but that didnât work and I didnât like the way it came out but it looked the same as what you get in the pet stores. Overall I love this machine and use it at least once a week.",
