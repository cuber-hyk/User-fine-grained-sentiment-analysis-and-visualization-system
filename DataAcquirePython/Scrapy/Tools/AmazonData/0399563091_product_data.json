This book is based on the lives of members of the author‚Äôs family and the tragedies that they faced as well as the many challenges were heartbreaking at times. I was gasping at the atrocities that mankind forces on their fellow man as I read the accounts of how the members were able to survive, some just barely, and how they became separated. This story is one that needed to be told and is beautifully written, with realism and characters that speak to the heart.",

    "content": "I just finished this story and I don't think I have words to describe how inspiring it is. There are many stories, thousands, of those who survived the holocaust and the horrors of World War II but I cannot remember one that is as eloquent, touching and hopeful as \"We were the Lucky ones\". We become inured to the numbers and the statistics, the hardships, the starvation, the camps, the post war migration and more but this story focuses on the small things that mean so much to all of us. The hand kerchief made for a son by his mother,  family celebrations, joyfully tossing a laughing toddler into the air; the small things that make us happy. Counterpoint is survival, resilience and rebuilding lost lives. Ultimately, it is not the things that matter, it is the people. Those who are willing to climb the Alps without complaint or to persevere through starvation, hate and torture so that they can once again enjoy the small joyful things. I cannot comprehend the mental and emotional strength of those willing to get into a box car on a train  to Germany in order to get to the United States, knowing that that same boxcar carried thousands upon thousands to their deaths in a concentration camp. The author has written the story of her family with a \"third eye\" and has fluidly captured the events of World War II, pre and post war, as they happened to one family starting in Radom, Poland. Interspersed in the story are short chronological events of the war that reflect on the families survival and are integral to understanding what happened in Poland. We often forget that until Hitler decided to invade Russia, Stalin was allied with Germany and that the initial split of Poland was between Russian and Germany. WW II still affects every person in the world and still impacts many political and diplomatic issues. The story leaves the immensity of WW II to the reader while focusing on the effects it had on one family. It is a remarkable story and I found the afternotes to be just as mesmerizing as the book. And what a surprise when I recognized the name of Addy who changed his name to Eddy when he came to the US. If you go to you tube you can listen to Violin Sonata No. 2 that he wrote with the hope it would be played on Polish radio. It was. It really is about all of the small things that make us happy.",
