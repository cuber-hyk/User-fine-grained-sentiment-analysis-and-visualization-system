This has caused it to slip from our hands, gouging the shower floor. If you’re looking for a good squeegee, this one is great, but we no longer use it in our shower.",

    "content": "First impressions are nice but I purposely waited a while so I knew how I really felt about this squeegee. I moved into a new home with a glass shower door and I found it looked not so nice with everyday use. If I spend 2 minutes using this after every shower it prevents mold and keeps the shower looking great for way longer between deep cleans! My kids have played with it while bathing and even they haven’t found a way to damage or break it- so it’s also durable.",
