The narrow base on all sizes (except 64oz) fits just about any car cup holder, keeping it right by your side.  ",
        " ADVANCED LID CONSTRUCTION: Whether you prefer small sips or maximum thirst quenching, Stanley has developed an advanced FlowState lid, featuring a rotating cover with three positions: a straw opening designed to resist splashes with a seal that holds the reusable straw in place, a drink opening, and a full-cover top for added leak resistance. We‚Äôve also included an ergonomic, comfort-grip handle, so you can easily carry your ice-cold water to work, meetings, the gym or trips out of town.  ",
        " EARTH-FRIENDLY DURABILITY: Constructed of 90% recycled BPA free stainless steel for sustainable sipping, the Stanley Quencher H2.0 has the durability to stand up to a lifetime of use.

        " DISHWASHER SAFE: Spend less time hunched over the sink and more time doing the things you love. Cleaning your tumbler and lid couldn't be easier, just pop them into the dishwasher. Unlike plastic bottles that retain stains & smells, this metallic beauty comes out pristine  ",

She wasn't a huge water drinker and if this helps her drink more, it is well worth the cost!! Looks good, too. The only thing she dislikes is that it leaks when tipped but it's not advertised as leak free (I don't think anyway). She wants to order something to make it leak free.",

I did a test where I put crushed ice, not cubed, filled it only halfway with ice and then the water. I timed how long the ice lasted and it was almost 40 hours later and the ice was finally gone! I swear this tumbler is the only way I can drink plain water, as it just tastes better in my Stanley. Maybe it‚Äôs a psychological thing but it‚Äôs worth it to me. I haven‚Äôt had issues with leaking, I use the straw through the straw holder part. The handle is perfect for my small hands, and it has the nice smooth grip. It‚Äôs easy to hold and it fits perfectly in my cup holders! I‚Äôm so glad I got this tumbler! Trust me, it‚Äôs worth the price!

It spends the night inside the refridge and holds the cold and ice like crazy!

She uses it DAILY!  and loves everything about it!  Cleans up nice, fits in her bag when needed and keeps drinks ice cold for a long time!  I definitely made the right choice here!  Excellent gift for someone on the go or office staff.",

    "content": "The cup is mostly made with excellent materials. I just wish the cover wasn't plastic, but at least it looks durable and safe for food/water contact. The lid doesn't leak when properly screwed and retains the liquid's temperature very well, to the point that ice cubes will last for a whole 24h. It's easy to clean and fits well in all cup holders we have around and the handle makes it easy to carry when it's filled up and heavy.",

Sometimes it can be difficult to determine if it‚Äôs the right shade depicted in the listing but after much searching online, the shade seemed consistent enough to purchase. I was going to get matcha cream but this most color was calling me. I ordered a cup prior in melon, which costed more but cancelled it and purchased this one. Love that the opening rotates. Never had a Stanley cup before. And my only concern is that Amazon should include better protective packaging. Luckily the worker was conscious enough to not throw it down roughly or it would have been dented up.",

After 2 days it still had some ice in it and after 3 days while the ice was melted the water was still quite chilled.  Still working on seeing how well the heat retention might be with something like coffee or tea, but have not had any really cold days yet to completely verify it's abilities.  With the results of the cold tests versus my closed up car on quite hot days I have no reason to expect the retention of hot drinks to be anything except the same high level of ability.",
