    "content": "This story hits the ground running and doesn't stop. Major Cook's CID team is called in to investigate the massacre of seven civilians allegedly by four Army Rangers. But the pieces fit together a little too well. Why won't the Rangers defend themselves? Why is the local sheriff so unforthcoming and hostile, even when the CID team is treading lightly on her turf? Why are some key Army personnel blocking their access to important information?",

God Bless our brave soldiers for all they do and have done and to law enforcement for the same. There is always good fighting against evil in our world. Hope and pray that the good wins. Thank you for such a riveting story.",
