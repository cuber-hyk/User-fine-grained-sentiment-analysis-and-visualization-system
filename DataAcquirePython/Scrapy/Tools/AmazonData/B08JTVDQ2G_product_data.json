All the tools are useful with convent storage. It has a pull when using, can't explain well, when vacuuming but I think that is due to the suction some how. The suction is adjustable with a slider.  You can attach the hose with attachment to the bottom side of the vac., and sit the vac., on its back end for storage, takes up less room. The bag is huge. Hose length is good and power cord good length. I like the fact you can just step on a button and bring the power cord back in. Noise level about med loud, I have had louder. I feel a GOOD vacuum is an investment and I hope to have this one for long time to come, tired of looking for a GOOD vacuum. I do recommend this canister vacuum.",

I have to adjust the height and the suction to prevent that from happening. It also is not made as sturdily. It’s OK and I’m glad I got it.

The Miele was a lot more expensive but had two irritating flaws... The wheels wouldn't roll over the electric cord so always getting stuck, and there was no power switch on the wand. This new Kenmore has all the features that we like, including that switch and the ability to roll over the cord, but the hose is slightly shorter, which sometimes forces me to pick up the canister when vacuuming up high. It does weigh less than the Miele. Overall, it's a good product. We have another older Kenmore canister vacuum that has held up beautifully.",

I stumbled on this machine by searching for top-rated vacuums and boy am I glad I did. This thing is a beast! In 'carpet' mode it basically runs itself, you just hold on for dear life as it drags you around the room. The tools are easily accessible and powerful, and the retractable cord is a fantastic touch.  I noticed a difference in the look and feel of my carpets after the first use. Now, this vacuum is not for everyone - it's heavy and a bit cumbersome but overall, I'm glad I made the switch!",

    "content": "I have been a Kenmore canister vacuum user for 20+ years. I had my first one (refurbished) that lasted me 10 years. Then my second one, throughout my 10 years as a cleaning lady (cleaned A LOT of houses), and finally just purchased my third one. I upgraded to this model because I really like the ability to use my foot to release the carpet attachment and go right to the hardwood floors without having to attach the floor attachment piece. As a Kenmore canister user, I was a little skeptical upon opening it because I noticed for the first time this floor piece attachment is very different from all their other models and I like their floor piece so much! But so far so good! It does seem to do as great, if not a better job than the older models. My hands-down reason for this vacuum is, as a cleaning lady, I have vacuumed many houses and the motorized powered pet mate attachment is just a must for me that I can't live without and no other vacuum on the market has. It is the only way (to me) to clean carpeted stairs, or stairs with a runner, or furniture (think under the couch cushions!) especially if you have pets. A regular suction attachment just doesn't do it! You need the motorized power. My only complaints would be that I'm disappointed in the flimsy cover. It is thinner plastic than the previous models, and doesn't feel like it would hold up well to high use, however, with the floor attachment already attached with an easy step release button, maybe it won't be a high use feature. The other negative is that the height of the carpet attachment is a tad bit higher than the previous models and doesn't quite fit all the way under my couch with ease as the other ones did. They still have the full swivel so you can make your vacuum pretty flat when you swivel the handle down, but the part where the hose attaches is larger or sticks up more so I have to swivel a certain way and go a little slower than I could with the other models. I should add that I first ordered the plush carpet (the newest model before this one) first, as I wanted this one but it was out of stock with no date of when it would be back and I needed it! That one slid nicely under my couch with ease! But the cord was a foot or two shorter and did not reach around to my back door like previous models and like this one does, so I'm happy to have the longer cord again. Overall, no one outdoes the suction power or motor power of a Kenmore canister, and the pet-mate powered attachment is a deal-breaker that no others have so this vacuum is definitely worth the money if you are looking for a quality piece, I just wish Kenmore would not cut corners on the body (flimsy plastic) like it feels like they are. I'm not sure why, if it makes the vacuum lighter? But overall I am very happy with my new (and pretty!) vacuum and expect to get a good 10-20 years out of this one!",

    "content": "EDIT:  The post below this paragraph is how I felt after using the vacuum for a couple of months.  However about 4 months after purchasing, the hose attachment broke at where it attaches to the vacuum.  The hose is where you turn it on, so you can't use it if it's not connected.  Submitted the warranty request to Kenmore the next day. Called every couple of weeks to check in and was told the part was on backorder.  There was a miscommunication around 2 months in, where a representative told me they had some in stock and that I would be getting the replacement within a couple of weeks.  That was not the case, so when I called 3 weeks later and was told that they were still on back order, their way to remedy the situation was to have me wait another month and see if it came in, and then if it didn't they would offer an entire vacuum replacement. Safe to say it was still on back order, so at the end of Month 3 (almost month 4), I submitted all my info the request was approved 5 days later. The form I submitted said \"You should receive your replacement within 5-7 business days once processed\" but the \"Order Processed\" email said 25-31 business days, so I waited a month to call and check on the order/see if I could get a tracking number.  Lo and behold the vacuum is on backorder as well. So if you're looking to buy this and feel good about it because it comes with a warranty, just know they outsource their vacuum warranty support, everything is on backorder, and if you bought the extended warranty through Amazon, Amazon won't do anything because the vacuum is covered under the manufacturer warranty for the first year.  At this rate, I won't be surprised if I don't receive my replacement by Black Friday, and for that I'm docking stars.",

    "content": "We decided to go for a bagged vacuum since we have 5 cats, a dog, and 3 long haired humans and this thing is A BEAST!  It has great suction, plenty of attachments and the hose is long and has a large diameter so you don't have to worry about things getting stuck in there.  The maneuvering of the PowerMate attachment (the main vacuum head) takes some getting used to, but it's nothing that won't get better with practice. The telescoping wand is my husband's favorite feature. It's super handy for teaching the ceiling and getting the top of the cabinets.  Personally, I love the PetPowerMate attachment. I've never been able to get all the pet hair off of my couch so quickly. Normally with our old set up it would take 2-3 hours to unweave the pet hair out of the tweed-like fabric that makes up our couch, but with this thing it takes no more than 15 minutes. It's a life saver.  I no longer dread vacuuming my house!",

    "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars",
    "content": "So I LOVE Kenmore vacuums because of their reliability and they get the job done right! I've had at least 4 - which says a lot because it's the only brand I've owned in my 75 years. We have established they last, they have great suction and a variety of tool attachments. This one is bigger, heavier and more tricky to get parts together (and no it's not due to my age!). So I'm a manual reader (you guessed it, I'm not a man LOL) so the first thing I did after reading it was check everything out -open every nook and cranny. Don't check the rear filter! I spent over an hour trying to get it back in. Once I removed the filter to check it out and tried to replace it I could not get the cover to stay on. Each time I turned on the vacuum, it blew it across the room with rocket force (luckily this didn't break the cover). I could replace the cover easily without installing the filter - I eventually had to put the whole canister on the hose end and use my entire body weight to get that cover back in place. One thing's for sure it has a TIGHT seal - the next time I think that needs replacing, I'll be inviting a man over - hopefully he'll be stronger. My second displeasure is that having the floor attachment fit into the rug attachment makes it heavier & less manageable - it is wider than previous models I've had and doesn't fit under some furniture due to it's increased height. The crevice nozzle attaches under the handle (instead of being inside the canister with other tools) and it requires a extra firm yank to remove it and a study wack to reattach it. It has a few more bells & whistles than I've had in the past, but I'm not overly convinced yet they are worth the extra $$$. For instance, the dirt sensor comes on if it senses there is still something bouncing around in front of it - it's come on a couple times, but not in the high traffic areas where you would expect it- so am I convinced it's reliable? The slide button on the handle that changes it from floor to carpet moves too easily down to the carpet setting and the suction adjustment just below that is easily changed without meaning to if you grab that area to move the whole wand. Where the hose goes into the canister is not as smooth a fit and likewise the handle of that hose into the pole attached to the floor attachments. The floor light on the wand only comes one when using the carpet selection and isn't as bright or cover as much area as my previous model that had the light on a separate rug attachment. The suction is as good as they make and I do care about how well it cleans, so it will remain with me. It does have a longer cord, a fan cleaning brush, an indicator light for when the bag is full. But be prepared for a bigger, less mobile, heavier machine - if you're frail, can't lift 30 lbs easily and you're not a bit mechanical: look for something else. If you just want clean and have the extra bucks, you'll like this one. And it's such a girlie color...don't you hate reviews that just tell you about the color?",

Some have complained about the retractable cord, but I find it is great and so convenient for storage. The trick is to not expect it to retract cord if it is in anyway bound up.  It takes just a second to release the cord from any hindrance before pressing the button to rewind, and sometimes takes a couple tries to get it completely wound up. If it does stop without getting all the cord in the machine, I just give it a light pull to reset it, and push the button again and and the cord always winds up.  It’s such an advantage, instead of having to wrap the cord around the machine. And all the attachments sit neatly in the machine and don’t fall out.",

I thought a replacement would be easy to find, however I got the wrong size. What I ordered was for the standard Kenmore and was too small. My advice is Yes by all means buy this vacuum cleaner, you’ll love it - but then in additio,  order a bare floor replacement brush with it.  Search “Kenmore 600 vacuum replacement parts” where you’ll see an ordinary brush attachment. It seems Kenmore thought this new brush would be adaptable to all angles but it just never worked for me.",

This thing wanted to take off as soon as I turned it on. No joke! It does have a wide suction head so you cover a larger area quicker. Cleans really nice as well. You also can attach the long wand and hang it on the canister itself for storage. To me, this is worth the increase in price from the 200 series.

My 2nd \"premium\"Kenmore was very good and I still use it but it busted in a couple of places after us fell down a flight of steps so a little bit of hassle to use. I tried to purchase the best canister model that was sold by Sears and then Kenmore on Amazon but after I ordered I received notice they were out of stock. So I bought this one. It's supposed to be the same but a different color.  It's much more cheaply made than my previous Kenmore Vac. The wheels are sooo cheap. The plastic it's made of is very static and collects dog hairs so I have to vacuum the vacuum before I put it up.

    "content": "I don't really do reviews, but I have been very impressed with this machine. I have put this machine through its paces except for a shag rug. Most canister vacuums suffer the same fate, I would imagine. This device is a bit cumbersome. I have used it on about 4k sq ft so far on concrete floors, linoleum, low pile, medium pile, and hardwood. Depending on the attachment, it does a great job on every surface. It works great for dusting molding and baseboards as well. My only major issue was cleaning the carpeted stairway with walls on either side. The stair-balancing pieces work great to make sure it says on the stairs with me (within Reason). But with the stiff hose and general size of everything, I was bumping into both walls constantly. Overall, I am extremely happy with this unit.",

When I saw the Kenmore advertised on Amazon, I knew I di not need to look any further.  It arrived a day later than initially projected, but no matter.  When it was run for the first time, I was amazed at hos much poer powerful it was than the older Kenmore.  Quite satisifed.",

I love that all the attachments are tucked away in compartments right on the canister. The light weight & design make it easy to vacuum the stairs. The telescoping tube is a nice feature instead of having to attach a separate extender. The suction is powerful. The bags and filters are easy to replace. It seems well made. I'd recommend it.",

    "content": "As soon as I opened the box, you could tell this vacuum was built study. The hose was thick, felt high quality and unlikely to break or bend. The suction has an adjustment knob, which is beneficial for all the different attachments (high suction for my couch covered in dog hair, lower for curtains so you’re not sucking them up constantly). The hard floor attachment if effective. I do worry some about the abrasiveness of the wheels of the main head but the suction seems appropriate. At first use, it is quick, effective. Also the way the bag collects duct and doesn’t spread it back through a room is amazing. I’ve had previous canister vacuums that put half the dust back into the room. Bags seems like a pain, but I think that’s the key to keeping the dust and odors in the vacuum and not in the room.  Looking forward to using this more!",
