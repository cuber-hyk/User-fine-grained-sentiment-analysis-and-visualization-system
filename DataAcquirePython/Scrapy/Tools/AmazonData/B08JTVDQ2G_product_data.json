    "content": "Cheap POS with a $400 price tag. The old kenmore vacuums no longer exist. This was shipped to me less than 1 year and 2 months ago. THIS next section was my previous review. Ok I wanted another Kenmore vacuum because I've always used Kenmore canister vacuums. My first one was purchased in 1979 and lasted for years. My 2nd \"premium\"Kenmore was very good and I still use it but it busted in a couple of places after us fell down a flight of steps so a little bit of hassle to use. I tried to purchase the best canister model that was sold by Sears and then Kenmore on Amazon but after I ordered I received notice they were out of stock. So I bought this one. It's supposed to be the same but a different color.  It's much more cheaply made than my previous Kenmore Vac. The wheels are sooo cheap. The plastic it's made of is very static and collects dog hairs so I have to vacuum the vacuum before I put it up. I have hardwood and tile floors so prefer the pop out style instead of the heavy carpet style. When I have used the carpet attachment to vacuum a rug it's not the best so if you have carpet buy a different model.",

    "content": "Here's the BAD: the cleaning tools are absolutely WORTHLESS! Hairs collect all over the brush tool. Every few minutes I have to get out the crevice tool to clean the brush. The crevice tool has an opening on the sides and will such in anything around it...like the bed skirt. Even the floor attachment is not that great and hairs and lint collect on the little brush. It doesn't appear to suck up the dust that great because of the design. So a vacuum with a strong motor and great pet tool but the worst attachment tools ever. Honestly they should redesign and send replacements to all who previously purchased this vac. Kenmore is obviously no longer Kenmore. I'll never buy another Kenmore. I purchased this model in August 2021. It was supposed to come with a pet powermate. It did not. The attachments are awful. I still use my older model Kenmore ( however the pet power are no longer works) and this newer model  sits in the closet , is there anything I can do ? Can I get the pet power mate that was supposed to come with this model? Have the attachments improved at all. The brush attachment collects hair and dust but leaves it outside the brush instead of sucking it in the vac. I've had Kenmore canister vacs since 1979. Or is it $400 down the drain and I know  to never ever purchase a Kenmore product again?",

The carpet floor head doesn't connect correctly and will randomly slide off while I'm vacuuming, super annoying! One of the features I loved about my last one was the ability to adjust how strong the suction is, this model has that option but again, not as good as it used to be, it's a simple full suction or not, while the last one I could adjust until it didn't suck up my throw rugs in my kitchen, this one sucks it up no matter what.",

    "content": "I don't really do reviews, but I have been very impressed with this machine. I have put this machine through its paces except for a shag rug. Most canister vacuums suffer the same fate, I would imagine. This device is a bit cumbersome. I have used it on about 4k sq ft so far on concrete floors, linoleum, low pile, medium pile, and hardwood. Depending on the attachment, it does a great job on every surface. It works great for dusting molding and baseboards as well. My only major issue was cleaning the carpeted stairway with walls on either side. The stair-balancing pieces work great to make sure it says on the stairs with me (within Reason). But with the stiff hose and general size of everything, I was bumping into both walls constantly. Overall, I am extremely happy with this unit.",

When it was run for the first time, I was amazed at hos much poer powerful it was than the older Kenmore.  Quite satisifed.",

I love that all the attachments are tucked away in compartments right on the canister. The light weight & design make it easy to vacuum the stairs. The telescoping tube is a nice feature instead of having to attach a separate extender. The suction is powerful. The bags and filters are easy to replace. It seems well made. I'd recommend it.",

    "content": "As soon as I opened the box, you could tell this vacuum was built study. The hose was thick, felt high quality and unlikely to break or bend. The suction has an adjustment knob, which is beneficial for all the different attachments (high suction for my couch covered in dog hair, lower for curtains so you‚Äôre not sucking them up constantly). The hard floor attachment if effective. I do worry some about the abrasiveness of the wheels of the main head but the suction seems appropriate. At first use, it is quick, effective. Also the way the bag collects duct and doesn‚Äôt spread it back through a room is amazing. I‚Äôve had previous canister vacuums that put half the dust back into the room. Bags seems like a pain, but I think that‚Äôs the key to keeping the dust and odors in the vacuum and not in the room.  Looking forward to using this more!",
