When his mother dies, a social worker decides Demon would be better off in the foster system. He’s abused again by an old farmer who works him and his fellow fosters almost to death, but he meets a life-long friend in Tommy who will help him find a career. One of the other kids on the farm is the star football player for the Generals. Demon worships him only to find out later he has feet of clay.",

Sure, the stereotypes are all true, but do they all have to be in the same 450 pages?

I was especially open to learning about this part of America because I recently spent a week near Roanoke VA at a family wedding. I saw nothing on that trip of the world in this book except the good parts of Virginia that the protagonist sold me on. I was already offended on behalf of Appalachia in terms of how most media deride its citizens and mock them. Now I feel a kinship. Beyond that I feel inspired to read outstanding and engaging fiction again — and, as a somewhat lapsed fiction writer, inspired to write it. I cried; I was moved and surprised and also vindicated by plot twists I’d hope would play out. I laughed and had my mind opened. A deeply real and life-affirming journey.

With his ironic wit Demon narrates the story of his life from birth to adulthood. We learn that he was born to a teenage single mother, who was addicted to alcohol and drugs. They lived in a small community in the Southern Appalachians.  Here come disappointments…He becomes an orphan and we see his experience after this, including terrible foster homes. Some good things happen to Demon as well. His life is a rollercoaster, with many nauseating highs and lows. Speaking of highs and lows, he gets the physical kind as well when he joins the excess of painkiller addicts in his community.",
