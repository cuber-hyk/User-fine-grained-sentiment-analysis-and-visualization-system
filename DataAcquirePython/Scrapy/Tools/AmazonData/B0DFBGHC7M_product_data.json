        " Large Feed Chute & Compact Design：Our juicer machines upgraded 4.35\" inch large feed chute and 40oz capacity is larger than normal, while the size is smaller. You can juice whole fruits and vegetables without chopping. Moreover, the slow juicer doesn't take up too much space on a kitchen counter, which fits for a small kitchen, and can be carried to any part of the kitchen easily.  ",
        " Powerful Motor & Efficient High Yield：With a High-power motor, our cold press juicer separates the pulp from the juice well, providing you with better-tasting, purer juice. Cold press technology maximizes the retention of nutrients and reduces oxidation, extracting a high yield of vitamins for your satisfying juicing experience.
