It is also lightly lined so the nothing shows even with a white t-shirt on. I wasn‚Äôt sure about the net piece on the cup, but it prevents puckers or gaps that would be visible under a t-shirt. I‚Äôm  a fan of a more natural, rounded look so if you like lots of lift and padding this is not the bra for you! I would‚Äôve given it 5 stars but where the mesh/net piece is sown to the cup was a bit rough at first. It smoothed out after the 3 rd wash on delicate in a laundry net bag.",
