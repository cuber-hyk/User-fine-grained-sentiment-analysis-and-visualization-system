With that question, she begins her life of crime. But someone has an eye on her and soon she is caught up in a cat and mouse con game with a  handler, Mr. Smith, who controls her next job, next mark, and her next identity.  Smart, creative, and always trying to stay a step ahead, Lucca aka Izzy or Mia or Evie does her best to complete the job she is assigned. This  book is filled with twists and turns, suspenseful situations, and hold-your-breath action that never stops. I found myself rooting for Lucca no matter who she was or what her job entailed. She is a wonderful character! Smart, creative, dangerous, and desperately wanting  the dream she shared with her mother - a little house with a white picket fence, and a garden. But, Mr Smith is in control of her…one might say, he owns her. And, Mr. Smith plays dirty. A solid four star rating for this highly entertaining novel.",

I did have a hard time with the back and forth between present day and past years as well as Evie/Lucca’s jobs she had. I had to go back and remember who certain people were. I’m still a little unclear of the end….is she now the new “Smith” meaning she will continue this line of work as the head honcho or what. All in all, I couldn’t stop reading the book and it kept me interested and intrigued!",
