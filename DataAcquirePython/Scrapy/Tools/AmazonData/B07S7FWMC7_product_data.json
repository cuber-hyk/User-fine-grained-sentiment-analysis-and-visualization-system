Weight is in 0.2 increments, which is ok.  iPhone app connection often takes many seconds to connect, wish it were faster but it works.  The app works well and shows a lot of potentially useful data.  Not sure how accurate the foot sensor info really is, but it‚Äôs interesting.  Overall, a great scale and highly recommended",

The only bad thing and this may be user error is that it took me about 15 to 20 min to figure out how to get all the tiles to give me their readings.. But it was just as simple as going into my phone settings and pairing the scale with my phone and there it was working.. Once paired it makes the cutest sound when you step on it and it is recieved to your phone.. My phone is a Android.. But I will say I would buy more products from this company.. This scale compared to my other scale was only off by 4 to 6 oz.. Not much to complain about.. I'm a big stickler to watching my weight and that few oz off aka difference didn't bother me at all..",
