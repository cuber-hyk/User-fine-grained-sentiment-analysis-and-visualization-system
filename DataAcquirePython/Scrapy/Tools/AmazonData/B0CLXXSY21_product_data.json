    "content": "This small unit has a higher heat range than many competitive products. It may look small but it can dehydrate 2 lbs of blueberries in one batch. That is all I need. It is a workhorse for its size. I bought a competitive larger product from a different vendor and returned it for this one. That was a great decision.  This unit  is able to do the same amount of blueberries more efficiently than the the larger competitive unit. The fan in this unit is twice as efficient as the other unit. It because of its size is less expensive to run (less space to disperse the heat). The controls are much easier to use and more intuitive. This vendor offers a larger 6 shelf unit but the view oval window is smaller than the square viewglass on this unit. And the other units controls are not as nice and easy to use as this one. i recommend purchasing this unit.",

I made beef jerky 190 degrees for about 2 hours. Very thin lean beef. . Tasted awesome. I wish  it had more detail recipes. I guess with this one. Turn out delicious üòãI decided to keep it with the scratches. Also I thought the two containers were supposed to be glass . They were cheap looking plastic. Not even sure if it's bpa free. Probably not because it would have said.",

    "content": "Was smaller than what I thought it would be. I had an Excalibur and it just wore out. This one doesn't dry as well as the excaliber. Because of the fan.  I think a fan in back would be better. I dehydrate a lot for my pantry and after using for awhile it is ok. The companY got back with me pretty quick on my review and offered a 50.00 credit  for this which I thought was very nice.  I think I will probably exchange it for the bigger one. One plus is that it is very quiet and would be very  good for the occasional dehydrating. During garden season, I use mine every day.",

It works quietly and efficiently. I am very pleased that I can adjust the temperature low enough to preserve the color in my herbs. It even came with two silicon screens. Very handy. I am very pleased with this purchase. PROS: four stainless steel shelves with adequate space between their placement, easy to clean stainless steel interior, very quiet, adjustable temperature and timer, actually works efficiently!
