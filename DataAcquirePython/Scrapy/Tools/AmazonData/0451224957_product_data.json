I learn a bit more after reading this book and others how the British were extremely difficult to deal with. The only critique I would give this book, as a Retired USAF MSgt, on 18 September 1947, the Army Air Forces became the United States Air Force as a separate and equal element of the United States Armed Forces.  The author refers to these airman as Air Force.",

Freeman lays out the tale of POWs inside Yugoslavia and the OSS operation to airlift them out - this is behind enemy lines, mind you. The author does a great job of not only telling the story of the actual mission, but provides a good bit of the political nonsense that went on and nearly prevented it from happening. That is, how the U.S. was backing Tito over the Serbian general Mihailovich for political reasons, basically tagging Mihailovich as the enemy. The reality was the opposite as Mihailovich gave sanctuary to allied POWs and kept them moving to protect them from the Nazis. He was one of the real heroes in the story. The operation and Mihailovich's efforts were heroic. The saddest part of the tale was how long it took for the U.S. to recognize the risks and sacrifices Mihailovich and his supporters took and made to keep the allied troops safe and cared for, and how they helped in the rescue operation. A must read for any fan of history, especially WWII history.",

The characters in Greg Freeman's book, such as Arthur Jibilian, the radioman, and others were real-life heroes to me as I read and re-read those stories over and over. I know all the trouble they had with getting those radios to perform, and felt their disappointments with the huge airdrops to Tito and his Partizan followers and miniscule drops to the Chetniks.  Remember, this is all because of those British spies/moles in Cairo changing the news.",

    "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars",
    "content": "This is an outstanding book on the assisted evasion experiences of men who were downed in enemy territory during WWII, avoided capture, and survived to tell their story.  It's a story of the real meaning and importance of partisans helping military operators in very tough straights in an unfamiliar territory to stay alive each day, to evade capture and torture by an enemy, and to ultimately return to their own forces in Italy for medical aid or to fight again.  This book is also a very interesting story of a very important figure--a real hero, who is shot by a firing squad after the war because of the skewed ego/pride of a communist leader with an anti-west agenda.  The book includes insightful information about Prime Minister Churchill and USA President Roosevelt, some of their terrible choices during the war.  This book also reveals and discusses the impact of pro-communist elements within British, American and Yugoslavian organizations--affecting the lives of millions during and after WWII.  Without a few focused men (heroes) within the OSS, the Army Air Corps, and the partisans in enemy territory, this fabulous, life saving success story would never have happened. I commend them for staying focused on the importance of locating, assisting and recovering these 500 men and did not go with the flow and pressures on them to cancel their planning and not pursue this mission. I highly recommend this book become mandatory reading for military Survival and SERE instructors; Personnel Recovery policy makers, planners, and operators globally; US diplomats, and government leaders and national level organizations with international affairs roles and responsibilities.  Survivors in the Forgotten 500 included Americans, British, Russians, and others.",

I believe more books should be written that can use real world situations set in hellish circumstances that highlight the best of what we should strive to be.  This is the story of the Serbs and their leader General Mihailovic's heroic struggle to help over 500 downed American fliers, the faithfulness and fearlessness of the OSS personnel who worked so tirelessly, with much of the time spent working against our own allies who tried to thwart the rescue mission, and the airmen themselves who showed their faithfulness in trying to bring truth to light long after they were safely back home.

The gripping pace tied into the book compliments the scattered accounts of real men who lived through the Eastern European conflict. The book covers the extensive story of men who were apart of the U.S. air force targeting oil refineries in Romania. Around 500 men were shot down by the Germans and were left stranded in Yugoslavia. Gregory A. Freeman depicts the personal struggle through the eyes of several different men each experiencing their own adventure in a situation only the most resilient could survive and thrive in. The detail in a book telling a story from mid 1900s is top notch and keeps the reader interested allowing him/her to completely comprehend the setting and situation.  There is in fact, a counter argument questioning the substance of the writing style and accusing it of being somewhat elementary and juvenile in the way Freeman describes certain situations or tries to get a point across.",

The result was that you walked away with the impression that the author had too little background that he was earnestly trying to streeeeettttcchh out into a respectable book length.  The lack of first-hand evidence was inevitable, since ithe story was uncovered when the whole WWII war generation was dying.  Add in the overwhelming Cold War paranoia, the dissolution of the OSS, and the secrecy of the mission, and it becomes clear that gathering recorded evidence of the breathtaking courage and defiance demonstrated as the story unfolded would have been a Herculeann task.",
