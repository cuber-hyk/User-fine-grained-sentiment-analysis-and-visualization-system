It is great quality material and is so universal that it can be worn for a variety of events! You can dress it up or wear it casually and be active in it! It has large/deep pockets that are great for keys/small wallets. I bought a cropped white tank to go underneath of it which completed the look! There is a full-body romper with shorts that is fitted, but not too tight or restricting. It is the perfect length and it's straps are not uncomfortable at all! The color is so perfect and looks exactly like the picture! I would buy this again and again!!",

The color is beautiful and the dress is excellent quality. This brand makes good quality clothes!! I like to wear an undershirt with build in bra, so I don‚Äôt have to mess with a strapless. The built in romper provides amazing coverage at the arms, so a bra would be totally hidden. So much better than having to pay for the brand name, and honestly, I like this one more! Such an amazing value. The length is great and not mini at all. The under romper is stretchy, so it‚Äôs bump friendly too!",

The other thing is, once you take it off, its like a puzzle to get it back in the right configuration to put it away!  It gets all tangled up because of the insdie body suit versus the outside dress that are attached!  Love it though and would buy it again, maybe with another vendor that sells the XS so the arm holes aren't super loose.",

I think it‚Äôs about 1-2 inches too long for me. I may have it altered. The underneath bodysuit has zero compression to it so it won‚Äôt help if you have an apron belly like I do. However the overlaying dress doesn‚Äôt seem the cling to my belly thank goodness. Also if you have a big bottom it will make it stand out. Either way, I think I will keep it regardless. I always have a hard time with rompers because of my bigger backside and I think this dress I can make work, as if I sized up to an XL, I think it would be too big up top. Definitely needs a longer sports bra or tank top underneath. Also I was hoping the material would be a little thinner for summer, bc it feels like a thick cotton.",

You have to take the entire dress combo off to go to the bathroom, which I knew before I bought it so I really can't complain.  It is not very forgiving unless you have a flat tummy, no curves and some acrobatic skills to get the dress off.  Maybe I was doing it wrong but to take the dress off there was not much \"give\" around neck line/straps to get it down and then you sat there naked because the whole point is you don't have to wear a bra with it.  I kept the dress but would never wear it in public because 1. no bra support 2. the nakedness in the restroom 3. did not hide my flaws.  I wasn't expecting a miracle but you always hope you will find that one amazing piece that makes you feel good about yourself.  This was not it.  Not the dresses fault.",

I have a C-section belly with a mind of its own. The last time I was measured for a bra (VS about 2018) I was a 40C.  The large fits me really well. It doesn‚Äôt cling to my midsection. The bodysuit underneath is fitted but far from ‚Äútoo tight‚Äù. It doesn‚Äôt dig, the shorts don‚Äôt ride up. Don‚Äôt expect it to fit like shapewear. I‚Äôm not super fond of the design of the pockets, it reminds me of Pippi Longstocking. However I am thankful to have pockets.  This one did not have the bra inserts in the top like other dresses I viewed. It‚Äôs fine with a sports bra underneath.  I have never been a dress person but wanted something fun and different but still comfy for summer. It‚Äôs 97F as of about 15 minutes ago and I don‚Äôt feel overheated. I did worry about that given it‚Äôs two layers technically but it feels nice. I have worn it for a few hours today while running errands and the sweat marks are minimal. I got this as a Mother‚Äôs Day gift and will be getting more for summer. I could sleep in this if I wanted because it‚Äôs that comfy.",
