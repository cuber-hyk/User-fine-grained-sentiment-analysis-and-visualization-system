I've bought more expensive steamers and I'll have to say this one works way better so for the price it is a great value. You fill the tank from the bottom but the fill line is when tank it upright. So that's the only thing I would improve. I drew my own fill line for when I'm filling it, lol. Highly recommend",

    "content": "Once I got this, I immediately pulled out a blouse that has been sitting in my closet for a year or so, in desperate need of ironing.  It is a 2-layer top, with the layers bound at top and bottom, so you cannot just iron one layer. The inner layer is tank-top like, made of a semi-thick stretchy material, and this same material is what is used for the waist band of the top. The outer layer is a very thin see-through layer that also stretches a bit. Even after being ironed, washed, ironed again and washed again, it still has some of the original shipment creases. So I decided to try this steamer on it. First thing I noticed is that trying to pull any stretchy material taunt enough for the steamer to really work well is almost impossible, making the steaming more difficult. There were a few areas of the sleeves that I was able to iron against the door that the top was hanging on, and those areas did come out mostly wrinkle-free. The thicker stretchy waist band was even more difficult to get the wrinkles out of. After using the steamer for approx. 15 minutes, and thus it was about empty, the top still has some creases here and there. Ultimately, I'm going to have to iron the top again. What this tells me though, is that it is likely only going to work well on stiffer material, whereas most of my wrinkle problems are similar to the top already described - some sort of thin flowy stretchy material. While it is possible that using this in a flat method might make it work a bit better on these stretchy materials, I already have a regular iron with steam ability, so I don't need that function. What I need is something that I can use quickly to steam out wrinkles. Debating on whether or not to return this one and try something else.",

I hung it up and steamed layer by layer, letting it dry some between the layers before moving to the next. The more delicate dress was also hung in preparation for steaming. It took longer than expected to remove wrinkles, and not all came out. I followed the manufactures instructions and let the steamer heat up well. It seemed too much work, for me personally, probably due to my age. It was not convenient nor easy to hold the steamer in one hand going vertically. I can go horizontally on the table with my steam iron, more easily. I truly believe I would have gotten better results. It seems to be made for small items; and will perhaps work well. Both my standard steam iron and the handheld steamer have nearly the same size box, so both should travel well. I did return the handheld steamer, as I personally had a difficult time managing with it. I took off a star due to the product not being a multi-generational product.",

The Shark lasted about 8 years and I really liked it so I wanted something that could live up to it's performance.  I was a little leery of this model because it is significantly smaller than my old Shark and I wasn't sure that the build quality and performance could be matched in such a small package.  A perk of being smaller is that it's boiling chamber is a lot smaller so it heats up a lot faster.  From plugging it in and turning it on, it's ready for steam in less than 60 seconds.  There are a few things I don't like as much and a some that I prefer in this model.",

The only reason I gave it a 4 star rating is because of the large size overall and the small size of the water container.  I have to refill the container several times if I am steaming a few things at once.  I disagree with those who said it would be good for travel.  In my opinion, it will take up a good bit of suitcase space and if you pack heavy and are going to fly it could tip you over the maximum weight before having to pay extra.
