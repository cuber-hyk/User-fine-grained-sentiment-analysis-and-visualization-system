I kept going until there was hardly any water coming out of the spout and what sounded like a propeller inside got a bit louder. Connected the water tank back and finally STEAM!",

Steam quality is very high You get a lot of steam out of the reservoir the steams quality is full and hot, The only drawback is if you angle the steamer at a lower angle it does cause sputtering or spitting of hot water on the clothing and for certain materials this can definitely cause warping or sinks in certain materials. The court is long enough to work in a lot of areas, The accessories that come with it work well.",

The water reservoir is pretty big, so you don't have to refill it often if you have a big project.",

I almost left a cranky review, but after reading other reviews it sounded like I just got a dud. The replacement that I got was absolutely perfect! SO if you do buy this and aren't satisfied with the result, exchange it for a new one because I can't see how anyone could leave a negative review with how great this thing works. I was worried that, since I got a broken one, the replacement steamer would break easily. However, I have been using my replacement for almost a year now without any issues and it still works flawlessly! I highly recommend this steamer.",

I got tired of the ironing board and iron!  I really like the steamer.  It works as advertised.  Caution:  the steam gets hot!!!  The only reason I gave it a 4 star rating is because of the large size overall and the small size of the water container.  I have to refill the container several times if I am steaming a few things at once.  I disagree with those who said it would be good for travel.  In my opinion, it will take up a good bit of suitcase space and if you pack heavy and are going to fly it could tip you over the maximum weight before having to pay extra.  Overall, I do recommend it.",

I was afraid to use the iron on the mesh in case it might melt it. I eventually bought this steamer, which had a coupon available at the time.",

So far, I've only done the one layer of the top curtain, and there's a world of difference between that and the mesh layer of the other curtain. You'll want to stretch the fabric to get wrinkles out, which was easy enough with the mesh. I think I'll need a couple extr a hands for the thicker layer, however.",
