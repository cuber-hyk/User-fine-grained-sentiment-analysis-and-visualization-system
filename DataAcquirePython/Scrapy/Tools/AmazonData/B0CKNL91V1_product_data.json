    "content": "This is a book that should be read by everyone. This kind of prejudice and hate is passed down by parents who were raised the same way. Some one in the line needs to get say it stops here. I grew up with all that kind of thinking and segregation but thankfully my parents didn't think that way.",

    "content": "Set in 1968 when I was a very young man, this novel rings almost too true. It offers a pitch-perfect story that brings that era in the South alive, as the Civil Rights Act of 1964 collides with deeply ingrained Jim Crow culture. And it breaks my heart that the we as a nation are still stuck in the quagmire of racial and ethnic hate depicted, morphed into the 21st century. This is the best Baldacci writing in years, with the echoes of some of John Grisham's best social commentary.",

    "content": "I have been a David Baldacci from the get go and this book reminded me why I enjoy his books so much! As a former court clerk I always enjoy the legal parts of his books but this one is even more special. set in the 1960’s South this is a story of racial and gender inequality during a time when the KKK still ruled in large areas south of the Mason -Dixon line. What makes it so moving is that I am old enough to recall some of the events; Dr. King, Bobby Kennedy, the KKK, John Birchers and George Wallace. I hated the violence then and I hate it now. some things have changed and some have not. This was an emotional walk down memory lane - the marches I attended and the fierce feelings that injustices bring to mind.",
