I don’t know if it’s the fitting on the pot, or the silicone like material but it takes a while to drain all the water out (slow towards the end). You can’t tip the pot past a certain point or the noodles will go around the strainer and out of the pot. All in all, not bad. But almost prefer the old dump method of a regular strainer.",
