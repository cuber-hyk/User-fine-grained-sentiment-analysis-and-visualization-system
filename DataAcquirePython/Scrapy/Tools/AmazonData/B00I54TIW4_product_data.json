    "content": "The current divisive political rhetoric is absolutely abhorrent to me, so when I read this book, I was happy to see that it addressed the issues in a fictional story.  It seems impossible for an author to anticipate what might arise in politics, but John Hazen's prescient portrayal of the damage that bombastic language can do in our society was fascinating.  Who were the heroes?  Interesting to even imagine that a news reporter might actually team up with the FBI to be more effective than either on their own.  This was a terrific book that is perfect for our uncertain times. It is suspenseful, but in the end, it is uplifting and hopeful.  How can we all learn to live together?  Should we distrust government because of a few bad apples? Having traveled to Israel, it was a pleasure to read the descriptions of the country, and the good heartedness of the people.",

There are a few areas where it's evident the author changed his mind about how he wanted to write, to the point where certain sentences change meaning.  The plot, while not very believable, is at least developed enough to be entertaining.  Suspend what you know about reality, and just go with it.",
