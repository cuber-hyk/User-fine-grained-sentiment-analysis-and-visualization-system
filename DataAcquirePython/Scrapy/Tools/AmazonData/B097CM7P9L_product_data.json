        " Effortless and efficient cleaning: Innovative ultrasonic water spray nebulizes water into dense mist to deliver unparalleled cleaning results without leaving water stains. A powerful vacuum (7kg ascending power) safely attaches the robot to the surface while extracting dust and removing all impurities.  ",
        " Safety and reliability design: An auto-adjustable pneumatic pad automatically controls the driving force and keeps the force between the caterpillar treads and cleaning cloth in balance. Auto-edge detection with AI-smart route planning navigates the robot in zigzag pattern in horizontal and vertical directions suitable for frameless windows. A long (15 ft) safety rope and embedded UPS (Un-interrupted Power System) prevents the robot from falling in case of a power outage.  ",
        " Large cleaning area and position memory: Large size (9.5 X 9.5 inches) cleaning cloth with extended corner coverage to reach deep into corners. Long power and included extension cords provide a wide range of cleaning coverage ideal for not only residential use but also small-scale businesses such as restaurants, cafes, offices, etc. The robot automatically returns to its starting point once the window is cleaned, ensuring easy access and removal in hard-to-reach areas.  ",
        " Dual replaceable water tanks and edge-leakage sensor: In case the ultrasonic spraying nozzle is clogged, simply replace the entire water tank or spraying nozzle with a standard screw driver. The edge-leakage sensor technology can detect air leakage caused by the slight lift around the window seal or the edge of the frameless windows.  ",
