Yes, a number of factors go into using these scanners but it seems like we get such a wide range of temp readings depending on where we scan. I don’t feel like a single reading is actually accurate so we scan multiple areas of the face/neck and basically go with an average of all the readings. I am a health care professional so I’m no stranger to these scanners but even I question their accuracy. They are quick and easy though, and we enjoy that it beeps and flashes differently when a higher temp is displayed. It’s quick and easy, just not sure how accurate.",
