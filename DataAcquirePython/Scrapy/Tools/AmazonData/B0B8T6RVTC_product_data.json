They wash well, stay up, keep feet dry and are thick enough for even MN winters in short boots, uggs, converse, nike, literally anything. My favorite everyday shoes are Hey Dudes and Blow fish: “fruit” is the item name…they work in all kinds of casual canvas sneakers. My other fav thing is these stay hidden but dont make feet sweat or get stinky. Highly recommend. Id get Smalls for size 4-7, M for 7.5-8.5 and L 9+ … also I dry everything on either low, medium-medium high heat so Id say dont dry in high heat or they will possibly shrink and melt the rubber strips on the heels to keep them up.",

Those small socks will stretch to fit on my feet, but they squish my toes.  So, I went back and ordered those same colors of socks in size medium.  The vendor's size chart is wrong!  If you wear women's US size 7. 5 shoes, save yourself a headache and buy the mediums!  They are much more comfortable.  You do have to be careful when you first put your shoes on, so that the socks don't slide up your heel too far, but once your shoes are on, the socks are great!  The silicone strips keep the heels in place and your toes don't feel like you've stuffed them into a pair of children's socks.  See my pics for the difference in lengths between the smalls and the mediums as compared to my foot.  I'll be donating my brand new packages of small socks to the thrift store!",
