I was a little frustrated as i ordered it for a specific time were I was going out of town and it was it in on time as promised. I did reach out to customer service and they were a big help. When I finally got the tank top in, it was super soft and very comfortable to wear. It’s also a Bit on the loose side, so it’s not a snug fit at all. It’s definitely a loser fitting tank top. You can truly dress it up or dress it down. I love this tank top!",

If you zoom in you can see the discolouration in the fabric - like “water marks” that have been on every single one of them - I’m so tired of returning them and reordering that I’m just keeping this one to wear at the beach - I’m giving up. I’m 130lbs 5’5 34DD. The M is HUGE. There is so much material - it hangs way below armpits and def shows my strapless bra band and would show major side boob. There’s no avoiding it. A S is too big too. The material is quite stretchy and therefore won’t shrink - I’d most definitely size down. Probably wouldn’t recommend to anyone.",
