    "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars",
    "content": "I really like using this because it makes chopping up my veggies so much easier and faster. I only use one of the blade attachments, but that one I've been using works great. It's actually kind of difficult to clean though. I wash it by hand and the food often gets trapped in the edges of the blade and the top part of the chopper so I always go in with a knife or something flat to get the food out and then wash with soap. I've never tried putting it in a dishwasher, so I don't know if that would work better.",
