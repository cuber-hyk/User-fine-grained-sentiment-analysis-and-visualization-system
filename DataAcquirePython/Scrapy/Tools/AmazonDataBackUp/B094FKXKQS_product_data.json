It makes it sound as though it does something special when you set it to the 'baby' setting - but all it really does is holds on to your weight and then deducts that from the total weight when you pick up the pet/baby. I can do that in my head pretty easily with my regular scale. I thought it might set it to a more sensitive setting, but it turns out it's not accurate at all below 13 lb, so not suitable for my purposes.",

The most annoying part about it is that I have to reset it almost every time I use it, or the next time I turn it on it'll read around 1-2lbs without anything on it. It's made of glass so I try to keep it away from where anything could fall on it and break it, but otherwise it's a great little scale. Budget things work in budget ways and I can't complain too much ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ as far as the accuracy goes though, it read my 10lb weights either correctly or at least 0.1 over so that's not bad at all.",

My fix has been to remove one battery, then put it back in, then set it on the floor. Then it always seems to zero out properly. Other than that, it is worth it since it wasn't too expensive.",
