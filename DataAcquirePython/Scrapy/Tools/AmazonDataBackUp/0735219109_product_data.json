I grew up with the adage \"different strokes for different folks\" so not everyone will enjoy WHERE THE CRAWDADS SING. Unfortunately, it is a tragedy that reading the classics (in addition to more entertaining \"beach reads\") is no longer a requirement or is not as strong as it once was. Reading many voices and genres contributes to an appreciation that staring at text messages won't necessarily satisfy.",

Kya is not the first young child (real or imagined) who had to (has to) survive against many odds: in Kya's instance, the erratic Monday money for food while still a child just to name one. Other discussion points such as whether or not it's fire flies or lightning bugs is so beside the point IMO since it depends on where one grew up. We called them lightning bugs but out of town relatives called them fire flies. They are the same insect and very entertaining to watch. Kya tells us much about these insects that I did not know and this information fit into the story. (BTW, there is a great show in the Smokies put on by lightning bugs (fire flies) during their mating season. People actually take chairs and go watch!)  Aside from quibbles about southernisms (LOL) some have, the book holds one's attention from beginning to end. The ending was perfect. It suited the book I believe. This book has earned its 5-star rating and I hope Ms. Owens writes another book soon.",

I expected an overhyped, over-written novel, and when I read the first few chapters, I thought my assumption had been correct. The writing in the very beginning irritated the hell out of me as a reader, and I had to slog through it. After fifty or so pages, however, I finally began to grow an interest in the story, and this was singlehandedly because of the hint of a relationship in the making for a young Kya and Tate. The romance saved me, giving me cause to continue reading to figure out how things ended, and it was by far more interesting to me than the upbringing and struggles of Kya Clark.",

Even though I liked the elements of her character- nature loving, self-made, traumatic background, hard to trust- I still found this uncaring attitude towards her, leaving myself only really interested in what was happening with other characters. To me, this novel mimics the well-loved setting of the south-east of America but lacks a lot of charm in the actual story. So you may be asking, why are you rating it so highly?",

It takes clever writing and well-written characters to fool your reader, and that’s what Where The Crawdads Sing accomplished for me. Despite the heavy description and slow start, Crawdads succeeds in making up for the beginning with a great end. The entire legal case was riveting, and the people who were vying for Kya- a girl with a skewed sense of morality after years and years of distrusting others and living on her own- made the final verdict heavy enough to matter. It felt less like standing for Kya and more like standing for all those that cared about her; Her friends, her love, her little patched together family.",

The moral of the story: Belonging to the wild, belonging to the marsh, and the different rules of the natural world versus the world the rest of us live in.

The way she hones her abilities and learns to survive with what she knows, the way she builds a life for herself- these are the reasons I rate this novel so highly. I think it’s a wonderful display of character, for those who can sink into the novel.",

    "content": "Kya lives in the marshlands of North Carolina with her poverty stricken family. Her father is abusive and, one by one, her siblings leave and, eventually, so does her mother. Her father stays and he seems better for a time, even kind. Then he falls back into his old ways again and ends up leaving too. Kya tries school for a day but after being bullied, she doesn’t return. She makes it completely on her own and digs mussels to sell to the local store to bring in money for food. Tate, a boy a few years older than Kya, loves to explore the marsh. They become friends and he teaches her to read. With reading, she discovers and teaches herself to be literate and all about the marshlands and its nature. She illustrates and collects samples of everything she finds in her marsh area. Tate leaves to attend college and becomes a biologist and works in the marsh. He submits Kya’s illustrations and notes to a publisher and she becomes a published author several times over. She adds comforts to her house and lives well by her own wealth. She lives simply but she gets electricity and running water and other basic comforts that she's never had. When Tate went away to college, he realized that his life would be difficult for Kya. So, he doesn’t visit her for years. While he’s away, the local and popular Chase moves in on Kya. He tricks her into thinking he’s going to marry her, all the while dating other women. Kya eventually sees his engagement article in the local newspaper and ends it with him. Later, he attacks her, trying to rape her and he beats her up. She fights back and escapes. His body is found later and it looks like he fell from the fire tower in the marsh. Since he was a local celebrity, the police are pushed to investigate for foul play. Kya is arrested and faced with a murder trial. The whole time I’m reading the part after Chase attacks Kya, I’m hoping she killed him but I also don’t want her to be found guilty. The suspense builds to intensity and I couldn’t put the book down! Tremendously honest, heartbreaking and soul healing! 5 stars!",

The poetry was really annoying during most of it, but I did like the little twist at the end that she was the poet being quoted throughout the book, even if I wasn’t big on the work. I LOVED that she killed that SOB, because he totally deserved it, but I don’t really like that Tate had to be the one to find out. He doesn’t deserve to live with that after loving her for so long.

    "content": "The storyline in this novel is good, but not strong, and the lush, detailed descriptions of the North Carolina wetlands and marshes are exquisite. Kya is a sympathetic character from the beginning, but I felt like she never really grew much as a person. Her outlook on life remained childlike even into old age. The ending was not surprising other than the identity of the poetry writer, and while the last chapter wrapped those interspersed poems together, I found them distracting throughout the novel - I wasn't sure why some of them were there. I think I could have found the ending a little more plausible if Kya had shown any deep-seated anger for everyone who disappeared from her life (and everyone did), and she forgave some of them, but not others, and ultimately acted on one with a wave of anger I didn't get from her throughout the story. Loneliness and loss, yes. Some anger at those whose attrition she never understood, yes. But angry enough to do the unspeakable? I didn't get this vibe from her character's psychological profile.",

    "content": "As a lawyer, I thought the courtroom scenes were very well done, but when Kya's lawyer didn't put her on the stand to testify, I knew what the outcome would be. That probably wouldn't resonate with the average reader, so it worked well, though that part of the plotline was pushing the limits a bit. No matter how well-read Kya became as she educated herself with Tate's help (and unless she was a prodigy, she wouldn't have learned as much as she did in five years), I don't think she would have had enough experience with the real world or the knowledge to set up and successfully navigate her actions with the precision she did where Chase was concerned. The author also didn't do enough research into the State of North Carolina concerning distances (it's a good eight hours or more from the fictional town she lives near to Asheville), family histories (her father's family didn't come from a plantation near Asheville - there weren't any of those - mostly small farms), and dialects of characters from different parts of the state (the ones with accents were either evil or not, but Kya spoke perfect dialect free English). All that aside, this book isn't a bad first novel, though the author's developmental editor should have fixed some of the problems it has. I don't think it's bestseller material.",

The marsh and Kya (nicknamed “The Marsh Girl” by the locals) are equally the protagonists of this novel. Kya grows up in the marsh and while still a child is abandoned by her family. This leaves her with the marsh as her one abiding companion. “For Kya, it was enough to be part of this natural sequence as sure as the tides.” The marsh is not swampland. It is where plants and water depend on one another, creating a unique ecosystem that attracts its own species of birds and insects. As she matures Kya learns to paint and describe all the life forms of the marsh, eventually publishing books that reveal for the first time the secrets uncovered by her intimate and continuous observations of them.",

Kya can discern the same dominance hierarchies that create stability in the bird and animal kingdoms in the world of humans.",

From then on the book alternates between Kya’s life moving relentlessly to her arrest for the murder in 1970 and the course of the investigation from 1969 to 1970, both strands coming together in 1970 when Kya is arrested and put on trial.
