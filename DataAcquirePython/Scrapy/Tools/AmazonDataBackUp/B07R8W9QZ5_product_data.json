    "title": "Literally Guilty Until Proven Innocent",
    "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars",
    "content": "John Grisham's latest legal thriller, \"The Guardians,\" traces the steps of Cullen Post and the other lawyers and investigators of a nonprofit organization dedicated to proving the innocence of incarcerated persons who were wrongfully convicted.  The Guardian Ministry has a track record of having secured the release of 8 persons. This case concerns Quincy Miller, who has been on death row for 22 years.  The evidence against Miller, accused of murdering his divorce lawyer,  seems so sketchy, but once a jury found him guilty, it is exceedingly difficult to undo the damage.  As Post investigates, he realizes he is up against an elaborate conspiracy featuring well-connected players with deep pockets who will go to any lengths not to have Miller exonerated.  Post's efforts are complicated by shortcomings of the  initial investigation, planted and missing evidence, the perjury of witnesses, crooked local officials,  prison gangs, and drug cartels.  True to his typical writing style, Grisham provides a  straightforward, fast-moving pace, with intricate details and subplots that will make a reader wonder if it is too late (or too dangerous) for the Guardians to  uncover the real culprits so that Quincy Miller can be set free. According to the author's note, this book was inspired by separate true events.",

He spends part of his time visiting people in prison and running a prison ministry. While he conducts his ministry he runs into various who claim to be innocent. There are some that stand out but one in particular that peaks his interest and so he ends following his true calling with his first successful overturned wrongful conviction and release of a long term inmate. This follows along about 6 or 8 cases that working on in various stages with the goal to have the same results. This being said there were times I felt I needed a score card to keep track of all the individuals. But this book really follows one case in particular. This story has a lot of twist and turns and just like most of Mr. Grishams other books it is a pretty easy read that keeps your attention. I would definitely recommend this book",

That being said, this was an amazing book full of mystery, controversy and even inspiration.  Based on a couple of true stories, the book really makes you think about how many people have been wrongly accused and put to death.  I know better than anyone, thanks to a very good friend of mine, that some cops are dirty.  They will trump up charges, allow prisoners to roast in hell for crimes that they did not commit; it doesn't just happen in movies..  This is just one of those books that makes you realize that no matter how we fight it, racism and other forms of intolerance cloud people's thinking, even the ones that have sworn to uphold truth and justice.  Grisham does an amazing job of bringing injustice in society and in the legal system to the forefront.  In this way, the book inspires me to fight these unfair practices because, in the end, it is our moral duty to fight for those who cannot fight for themselves.",

Thank goodness I decided to read 'The Guardians'. It kept me riveted from beginning to end. I found how little I understand about how the justice system really works, how uneducated I am in the processes of attempting to free those wrongly convicted. Because the book is based on fact it became even more intriguing and educational. I bought a hard cover and gave to one of my adult children who works in the courts. I then bought the kindle edition for myself. This is by far one of the top reads for me this year, 2019!  And as Amazon knows, I'm a purchaser and reader of many books ðŸ“š.  Thank you Mr. Grisham for giving me a wonderful look into the criminal justice system, and a brief look into the time invested fighting for wrongs to be corrected.. A must read for those who need a better understanding of the plight of those wrongfully convicted and sentenced to prison, as well as those who are ordered to pay for crime they may be innocent of, through execution. For the innocent, may truth be found.",

How exciting can a novel about death row convicts regaining their freedom and being declared innocent be?  In this instance, it can all be pretty exciting and enlightening.  The novel is a page-turner from the beginning; and it never lets up.  We readers see a number of death row inmates reclaim their freedom, while we get a intensive look into our American justice system's failures in assuring that the innocent go free and the guilty face justice.  Thank God for organizations like Centurian and the Innocence Project.  Justice would not work without them!",

    "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars",
    "content": "John Grisham is one of my favorite authors and I have read all of his legal thrillers, excluding the Theodore Boone series.  The Guardians distinguishes itself from his former legal thrillers in that it focuses on legal exoneration--getting convicted murderers exonerated after years and decades of serving time for a crime not committed.  This book is about social injustice, why it occurs, and how devastating it can be on a human being's life.  It is also about lawyers who work for years without the high compensation of most lawyers to see that people wrongly convicted have a shot at freedom.  Cullen Post is one such lawyer--a good man using his talents and limited resources to right serious wrongs.  Because of the nature of the two main cases in The Guardians, the typical legal intrigue in a Grisham legal thriller is missing.  That said, the book is very interesting and informative about a serious issue in America--legal injustice, especially for black males.  The last 30 pages of the book are worth the price of the book.  I highly recommend The Guardians.",

The man was put in prison for over 20 years for a crime he didn't commit. Mr. Grisham said it played a big role for writing this book. Although I had read this book when it first came out I couldn't recall reading this. This story is eye opening on the way innocent people are put in prison for crimes they did not commit.

I found it tedious, too much thrown together, and not compelling enough to hold my interest without my forcing myself to finish it.  Learning more about the many innocent people wrongly incarcerated was interesting and definitely worthy of Grisham's publicizing.  But raising many threads and not following them to finish (the other current Guardians' clients described, then dropped; the evil cartel never followed up on to conclusion) is not good writing, nor are the hodgepodge of Gothic novel scariness (the haunted Kent house), the random characters who just stop by to offer pieces of the mystery history the main character needs, and the unnecessary and gruesome torture scene (doesn't lead anywhere and the character who brings it to us is dropped out of the novel).  The book went on too long and was too coincidental, full of disjointed, episodic events, and not compelling.",

Grisham uses first-person present tense, not a common use in novels today, but not unheard of. About halfway in or so, he seems to get stuck by this choice. There are a number of chapters later in the book where Post is apparently just telling what is happening in scenes where he is not present. Scenes necessary to the plot. Or maybe Grisham is just telling us, I'm not sure. Either way, those chapters take away the immediacy of seeing the action through the first-person protagonist. You feel like someone is just telling you a story rather than feeling a part of it. And the story itself really lacks suspense. I won't give away what happens, but its definitely not surprising. Plus there are places where its kind of disjointed as well. Your not quite sure which story-line Grisham is pushing. Not your typical suspense/thriller/mystery that builds to a worthy climax.",

    "content": "I have always thought that John Grisham's writing style was somewhat dry, sounding more factual in its descriptions than other authors who tend to use many mores adjectives and flowery language to create an image in the readers mind. This is just what one would expect from a lawyer. All that being said, Grisham still elicits those images in a more straightforward manner. He makes you feel like you know his characters, the settings his stories take place in, and the stories themselves are gripping and compel me to keep reading even when I know I have other pressing obligations to attend to. I have been a fan all along and read every book, usually starting as soon as it is released, for years I read the hard covers, and more recently, the electronic version. The Guardians is another example of his best, this time including a message about a noble cause, and based on fact. I  highly recommend it to anyone who likes to read any type of fiction.",

The main character in this book has a law degree and chooses to use it in a most meaningful, but low paid and tough role.  He helps free innocent criminals on death row and with life sentences.  The fact that there are people in the world who do such work with such personal sacrifice really made me think.  I loved that part of the book.  The actual criminal plot and plot line began to drag about 2/3 of the way through the book and was not as powerful to me as the main characters in the story.",

    "content": "After the unimaginative fluff of Camino Winds, John Grisham returns to what he does best:  Writing a legal thriller which, though fiction, is thoroughly grounded in reality.  In an afterword, he identifies a couple of real-life cases in which innocent people have been incarcerated and dedicated lawyers have fought to exonerate them.  Cullen Post, the protagonist, is a lawyer turned priest turned lawyer again.  Because of this, he has a depth of commitment not often seen in attorneys.  His work with Guardian Ministries (read The Innocence Project) is indeed holy work, and it takes him on long road trips across the modern South.  Post, as he prefers to be called, runs down witnesses who lied in the trial which put his client in prison for life twenty-three years ago.  There are some surprising twists, some colorful characters on both sides of the law, and an immensely satisfying ending.  Highly recommended.",

It's often not until average folks come face to face with justice, whether as a party to a claim, a victim of injustice, or juror, do they really begin to understand what's at stake and how easily the law can be misused and justice denied! John Grisham's  latest novel provides an opportunity for all of us to consider how important affording equal protection and treatment to all is in this system as well as how important checks and balances are both before and after a conviction.  This book is a sobering reminder that there are dedicated lawyers who face extraordinary hurdles every day to protect and defend us yet receive little in return for their dedication. Hopefully this will change, but for now supporting their efforts is up to the rest of us.",

But, that would be, I guess,  sort of treason.  The main character, Cullen Post, is like a cut out.  The others just do not jump off the pages. Every thing is sooooo very predictable.  I never review the plot of any book I review on Amazon because it can ruin it for others.  Grisham's other books were never all that predictable.
