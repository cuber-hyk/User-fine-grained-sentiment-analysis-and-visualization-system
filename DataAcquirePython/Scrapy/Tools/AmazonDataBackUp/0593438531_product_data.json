This was the first book in a very long time that kept me up until 3am—I absolutely could not fall asleep without knowing what happened that last summer. This book alternates between the past & present. Percy meets the Floret boys, Sam & Charles, one summer at her parents new vacation home when she is 13. She quickly becomes best friends with Sam and they see each other every summer & on some holidays. Charles was that annoying, but funny older brother who’s always picking on Sam & Percy. In the present, Percy & Sam (or Charles) hadn’t seen or spoken to each other in 12 years & we find out early on it’s because of something Percy did. When a family death happens, Charles calls her and it forces Percy to go back to the lake & confront her past.",

I can think of books that do this trope too: Love and Other Words (Christina Lauren), The Summer I Turned Pretty (Jenny Han), and Undertow (Elizabeth O’Roark). While I always feel kinda meh or a certain way about what keeps them apart in the past, I do always come back for this trope because it does have two of my favorite things: childhood friends to lovers and second chance!",

But even then Sam was kinda meh to me of why he kept her away from him and kinda of just always assumed they were end game so it didn’t matter how he acted/what he did before that. But again this premise of the story just always pulls me in so I liked it too. 😅",

This book was SO good, I could not put it down. It made me nostalgic for my own childhood summers spent at the beach and all the \"first time\" experiences that you have growing up and going through your teenage years. This story was so well written and so beautifully descriptive that you almost feel as though you're experiencing the story yourself. The author also did an excellent job with keeping both the dialogue and actions/reactions of the characters realistic and relatable, which is honestly one of the things I liked most about this novel. The story is told from alternating perspectives of the past and present, which I loved because it really keeps you engrossed in the story and gives you such a full picture of what has happened and why. I cannot say enough good things about this novel and I really hope that Carley continues writing because I would love to read anything else that she puts out. If you're looking for one of those books that you can't put down and feel sad about finishing, this is it! Truly one of the best books I've read in a long time - Carley Fortune is very talented.",

I did enjoy reading Sam and Percy’s childhood friendship and how it developed. There were a lot of cute scenes and over all, I enjoyed it. But there was just a bit of something missing here for me, and I’m not quite sure what it was except that I felt scenes were rushed and glossed over. Just when you wanted to dive into a scene with the characters, it was over. And the plot was fairly predictable. I knew what the catalyst for the break up was within a few of the first chapters. I wish we would have seen more flaws in all the characters and I wish it would have been a little more messy. I wish it would have made me care a little more.",

Carley did such a wonderful job with the past and present, creating that developed friendship that I crave in a story like this, and bringing forth the angst and drama. This is a top-notch friend to lovers’ trope. Their friendship was well developed, their interactions ache worthy, and their story was one for the books.
