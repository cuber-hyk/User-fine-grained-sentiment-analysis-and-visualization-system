It is fairly easily to clean because of the glass top, but also make sure to dry it before every use as it DOES get slippery when wet. As for the weight, it is very light and fits in most places due to its compact size.

It easily measures and records BMI, bone, water, visceral, and Subcutaneous fats and compares your measurements on an athletic to unhealthy range! This scale even measures and records one’s metabolic age in comparison to one’s chronological age! I’m very impressed!",

It may do it but I have not yet figured it out yet. I love that it takes AAA batteries and it auto shuts off. The quality seems great too but I’m sure if dropped though it may break I would not recommend for anyone with small kids that can get ahold of it.  The app is fantastic I love how it gives so much more that weight and BMI just wish I knew how it did water weight and protein and all that other stuff. I do recommend this scale especially for the price.",
