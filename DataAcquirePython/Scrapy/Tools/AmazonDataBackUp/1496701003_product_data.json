Its a decent story with lots of twists, but with one glaringly obvious clue to the culprit. Victims families always have a point of contact. Someone they interact with for updates, whether it is the investigator themself, or an appointed person. The fact that no one in Nicole's family was working with someone to try to find her was such a big missing piece it made it obvious law enforcement was involved. A couple of unanswered questions by the end and the wrap up seemed a little rushed. But, good enough for a one time read.",
