As I said before, I add it like a highlighter to add a bit of shine at the top of my cheekbones and collarbone. It is glossy and wet looking at first, but once the skin absorbs it in there is an effect of a glow from within. I've found when younger (gen x) we were pushed to make our oily teen skin look matte to appear more mature, but now that we are this recreates that youthful luminosity to the skin precisely where it is applied. I've also put this under my eyes and noticed a reduction in puffiness, but definitely apply it a bit before you need it to give it time to absorb.  I get compliments on my skin almost every time I wear it.",
