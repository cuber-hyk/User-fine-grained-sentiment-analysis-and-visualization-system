I recently read that a reader felt that Hannah's novels are predictable. This is an unfair comment as positive endings are sorely needed in today's world. In all her works, Hannah does an amazing job of writing from a woman's perspective and following the challenges and difficult choices her female characters face.  I eagerly am looking forward to reading all of her novels",

    "content": "Annie takes on the care of Izzy during the day and eventually, through love and friendship, Izzy begins to understand the loss and recover.  Nick has turned to alcoholism as a solace but, w/ Annie’s help and the help of AA, he learns that one day at a time he can cope w/ it all.  He falls in love w/ Annie but knows she must return to her home when her husband declares he wants her back.  The story is a good one and I kept an interest to the end.  A happy ending is always a good one.",

Her husband was a world class jerk and her daughter was conveniently out of country, so leaving her whole life behind was as easy as turning off the lights in her Malibu home.  No conflict at all.",

After 20 years of marriage and within only 3 months she somehow finds her true self by reconnecting with a high school lover.  Really?  And then gets pregnant - really?  I found the whole scenario completely depressing - that the heroine decides to fix the past by completely repeating the past with a supposed new found perspective on life that she somehow gained in only 3 months.  Really - that's all life has to offer?  Repeating the same thing over again and hoping this time, it's different - really?",

This was a good light read that kept me interested and had some great life lessons to think of as well.  Interesting and entertaining to me I finished it in only a few days.  I may have found it more appealing being that I am a mother now, don't think I would have liked it quite as much before I had a child of my own.",

I mean- I figured it out as I read, but a little space between shifts or a line or new chapter would have been a little better in my opinion.  I like for the book to prepare me for seeing things through a different characters eyes.  It obviously didn't put me off too much though, I am heading to the library today and plan to pick up another one of her novels.",
