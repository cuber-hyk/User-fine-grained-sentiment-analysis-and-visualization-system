I debated whether to return but decided to give them some time. My guest bath is mostly white and wanted to perk it up a bit. Mission accomplished. The down side is I also ordered yellow floor rugs and hand towels which are a more golden yellow. I figure complementary decor is better than too much matching.  Nice rationalizations.",

I bought the Malibu Peach and it is a very soft pretty Peach color. Going to buy another in an Aqua like color to go with my bathroom beach colors. They also have a bigger towel than this, but this size fits and overlaps my round body perfectly. Washes well in warm water not hot. Loses some fuzz in dryer like all towels do. No noticeable after fuzz. If storage is short I suggest rolling your towels up and stacking them, instead of folding and stacking ... It saves space!",

When I dried them the lint trap was almost 1/2\" thick with fluff and there was still all kinds of fluff on the towels. I shook the towels and whipped snapped them sharply and finally got all the excess fluff off them. But I expected better. 1 star, just because it left so much fluff in the washer, had to cycle it twice but there is still fluff in the washer. Not returning the towels but I will not purchase them again.",
