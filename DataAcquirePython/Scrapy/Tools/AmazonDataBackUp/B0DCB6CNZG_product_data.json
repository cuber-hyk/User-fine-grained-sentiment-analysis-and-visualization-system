This pad keeps the ceramic stove top free of crumbs and other falling stuff and gives me a substantial increase in my counter space. It's allowed me to do a cook a lot more complicated recipes since I can spread out while I'm prepping everything. It's easy enough to clean off the mat, although my sink is also very small. I end up washing it off in the shower, hang it on the side of the tub to dry, then return it to the kitchen. That doesn't bother me but I'm sure some people would question the hygiene. So, on one hand, it's given me more space to cook, but it has compromised my kitchen space when it comes to washing and drying it. I'd rather have the additional counter space!",

I makes the top of our stove look really nice and finished and it is great for setting stuff on and using it for another workspace.  It wipes up really nice and you can set hot stuff on it also without having to worry.  It is made of a silicone material and can be rolled up if you don’t want to use it all the time.  We just leave ours out on our glass stovetop so it is nice and convenient and always there when we need it.  I am hoping to get a smaller one to put on the glass stovetop in our camper.  It does a great job of protecting the stovetop from scratches.  Overall, we really like this mat and would recommend it.",

It’s light weight but thick rubber. It’s real easy to clean and you can use anything to wipe it down. Even with the glass is warm you can lay it on there and not have any issue with it melting as it’ll still protect your glass top. So far it works wonders and its quality is great.",

And thanks to this mat, I dont fret over things leaving a scratch.  The mat is thick and sturdy and provides all the protection that I need to keep my stovetop looking like new! I love this mat!!",
