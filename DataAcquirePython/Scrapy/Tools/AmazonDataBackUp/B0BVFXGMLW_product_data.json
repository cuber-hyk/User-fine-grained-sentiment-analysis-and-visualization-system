        " GuruNanda Pulling Oil is a natural, pre-brush rinse inspired by Ayurvedic wisdom, with lower density than coconut or sesame oil. It comes in an 8 fl oz bottle with a tongue scraper inside.  ",
        " It contains 100% pure coconut oil, essential oils (Tea Tree, Peppermint, Clove, Oregano, Fennel, Spearmint & Cardamom) & vitamins D3, E & K2. Hydrophobic & lipid-inspired, it enhances your oral care.  ",
        " Pulling Oil aids in saliva production & plaque removal and supports healthy teeth & gums & fresh breath. It's not a substitute for professional dental care but rather a preventive measure.  ",
        " Pour 10-15ml of oil pulling, swish for 2 minutes with the provided measuring cup, & gradually increase to 10 minutes. Discard the oil into the trash to avoid clogging pipes. Pull on an empty stomach every morning for optimal results.  ",
