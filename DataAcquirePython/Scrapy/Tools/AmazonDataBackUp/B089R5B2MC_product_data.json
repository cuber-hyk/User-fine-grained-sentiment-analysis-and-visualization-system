I bought a large based on what was suggested and I have more weight on than I would prefer, but with the yoga style waist and the cuffed leg I feel they are a winner even if you might be taller than 5’6",

So keep that in mind if you are wanting more of a jogger than a legging. The pants were uncomfortably tight, but the material did still feel like it was of great quality.

These are nice. But they’re not as good as my go to. They are less buttery and a slightly shinier feel (idk how else to describe it ok), but not like in a super bad way? They’re definitely a little more sturdy feeling than CKs but the downside is that there’s a seam at the top of the waistband, so what should be a nice tummy control panel becomes an instant mom pooch enhancer. Which as a mom with a pooch, I don’t love. They are longer than CKs so if you’re a tall gal that might be nice. If you’re an average or short gal it’s not ideal if you like your joggers to sit snug above your ankle. Pocket size and shape seem super comparable, and the leg fit is really similar besides length.",
