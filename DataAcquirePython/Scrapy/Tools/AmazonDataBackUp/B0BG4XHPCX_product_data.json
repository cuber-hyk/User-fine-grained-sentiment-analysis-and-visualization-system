I have the one in the blue color and it is very pleasing to the eyes. However, this is my first juicer so I dont have a lot of experience with juicing but I feel there are a lot of parts to it and its discouraging for me to use because I have so much to clean and air dry but that's just me. As far as the juicing abilities is concerned. I believe it juices very quickly, which is a double edge sword.",

I know you get what you pay for and I didn't know about masticating juicers until after I purchased this one, but I still  believe for what you pay, you shouldn't have to extract juice from the pulp container, but that's just me. So what I do is, I strain the pulp to extract the rest if the juice and at times, I save my pulp, put it in the freezer and use it for either fruit and vegetable smoothies or slushes.",

Its pretty tonlook at and not complicated to use, but honestly, if you don't plan on spending more money in the future to buy a more proficient juicer (like a masticating juicer), save yourself the money, and put it all toward a masticating juicer. Otherwise, this one will do. I hope someone finds this to be helpful. Be blessed!",
