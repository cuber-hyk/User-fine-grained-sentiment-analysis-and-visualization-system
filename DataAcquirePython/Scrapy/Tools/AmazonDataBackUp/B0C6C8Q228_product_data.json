    "content": "E L. F. Is killing it lately with their incredible products that rival brands three times their price! Was looking forward to trying this Halo Glow Beauty Wand Contour since it came out recently. I have fair/light skin tone and have a hard time finding a complimentary shade of contour at any price range. Most contour is too dark or has an orange tone to it that looks like mud on fair skin. I really liked the color of fair/light in the picture on Amazon and decided I had nothing to lose for $9. I ordered it last night around 10 pm and it arrived this morning at 8:30 am just as I was applying my makeup for church. The color is perfect! The fair/light shade is the most complimentary color for light skin tone I've ever seen. It was a light brownish-nude color that blended beautifully and easily for a subtle but definite contouring effect and it's buildable. Instead of standing out, it was more of a shadow on the skin that was natural and beautiful instead of a dark, glaring, muddy look. Great applicator, easy to use and no mess or spillage. I used a brush to blend. It's very creamy and didn't fade at all in the four hours until I took it off. It doesn't have a matte or luminous look, just very natural looking and didn't make my skin look dry and cakey. Excellent product at a great price. Best contour I've ever used and I've tried them all. I'm ordering the Halo Glow Beauty Wand blush immediately. I also ordered the E. L. F. Holy Hydration Cleansing Balm and was blown away. See my review for that too. No promotion, I paid full price for both.",

I like the warmness of the shade I bought because it's not overwhelming or orange. It can be a little tough to blend if you let it sit too long because it dries down so I use a damp beauty blender almost immediately after applying & that does the trick!",

In the winter I'm VERY fair, and my skin is neutral in tone and things seem to oxidize warm on me after application so finding makeup products that don't end up orangey or muddy or weird is an uphill process.  This product, however, is a delight.  No orange cast that makes it look like I'm trying too hard to look tan in winter, sheer and blendable as can be, the texture is really lovely and it carries just enough pigment to create the most natural shadow contour.  The sponge tip offers more precision than any other product I've used, and the tiny hint of jowling I've developed is thankful for that; nothing's ever going to make it look like my jawline is snatched, but it makes it so that's not the first thing that draws the eye. Honestly, this product has impressed me so much that I'm really motivated to try the Halo Glow blush and highlighter as well.",

When I dot it on my face it looks like it will be a good pigment, but when I blend it out using a blending sponge the pigment is not strong enough for effective contouring.
