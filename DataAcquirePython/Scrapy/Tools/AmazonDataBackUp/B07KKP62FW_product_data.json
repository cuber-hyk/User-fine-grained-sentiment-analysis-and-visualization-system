    "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars",
    "content": "Have to add to my review. I had admittedly not read the reviews on here since I read the book at the request of my husband. These reviews are really disappointing, but not because this book and this story are any less inspirational to me. It's because these people with the negative reviews (and yes they were read with an objective mindset) missed the point. You go in to each reading experience hoping to gain something for YOURSELF. People should check their own ego before claiming to be open to learning from others' experiences. My husband, much like Mr. Goggins experienced a very abusive childhood. Reading the reviews - not to pre-judge too harshly myself - I don't believe people realized that the minds/brains of people that grow up in severely abusive environments do not develop as those of people who grew up in more conventional families and environments. There is still a huge stigma surrounding mental health. So the one thing I can encourage readers is don't expect to learn from a perfect \"role model\" with these lessons, do not expect a man that has endured as much as he did to be eager to open his life up to you regarding his marriages and children. The story he wished to share was HIS story and what he overcame through these hard lessons was HIS experience. While what we each draw from this is subjective, your mind, your heart and intentions should most definitely be objective. There is mention of the foul language and misogyny. This is a testament to the fact that people only accept a message being received from someone like YOU. This is the opposite of getting out of your own way to learn something. It's not for the faint of heart or someone looking for a watered down version of someone's struggles just so you can walk away with enough inspiration to go drive your kids to school and go for your morning run. What a person like David Goggins had to overcome BEFORE mastering his own mind is more difficult than what most people achieve in a lifetime of privilege and comfort. His journey and story demands respect at the least. At best he is a HUGE inspiration to people who didn't have a shot in hell of making it let alone having an exceptional or even \"normal life.\" The greater the pain the greater the gain.",

As a 55 year old competitive female endurance athlete, I thought I might glean some useful tidbits and possibly some inspirational insights from the book. Although the in-depth description of Navy Seal training was interesting, and the book was well written, I have to say that for a guy who writes incessantly about feeling ‚Äústupid‚Äù and prejudiced against, he doesn‚Äôt do much to rise above (or lead by example) by lacing every page with non-stop profanity. I intensely disliked his various descriptions of female genitalia as a synonym for weakness. I get that it was Drill Sargent talk during Seal Training but Goggins defaults to it as self talk whenever he‚Äôs experiencing a low point in a race, and that‚Äôs on him. It‚Äôs actually disturbing that he can drum up adrenaline that way. In addition, while some of the points of this book are valid (as in how much time people waste on social media and watching television, yet complain that they don‚Äôt have time to exercise ), Goggins seems truly addicted to pain and suffering and doesn‚Äôt actually seem to be able to feel any other emotion. He is self-proclaimed ‚Äúthe badest mother-f*****‚Äù on the planet, and those words are repeated over and over throughout the book. Yawn. He perpetually overtrains with zero regard for how it‚Äôs affecting his body. No wonder he crashed and burned and trashed his adrenals. He‚Äôs lucky to be alive. This was more an autobiography of a tormented man who can‚Äôt feel happiness so seeks out endless pain to validate his existence, and is cheering the reader on to seek out the same. I understand the mental game of endurance but feel Goggins takes it to an extremely unhealthy level. You only get this one body.  If you unnecessarily destroy it, what then?",

Ended up finishing a Spartan trifecta and full marathon. When my 60 something dad congratulated me, he mentioned he has always wanted to run a marathon, and I replied that it's never too late to start.",

Let me just say that reading it for myself took my impressions of him to a new high.",

    "content": "David's story teaches a very strong lesson in fortitude that is applicable to ALL AGES (little kids to the elderly).  He's the \"real deal\" in demonstrating that the power of the mind can only be accessed and utilized when it has experienced hardship and suffering.  That means that we consistently miss out on becoming our best selves when we stay in \"the comfort zone\" all our lives and avoid difficult tasks. Thus, it makes complete sense to understand that taking the \"difficult and hard path\" (when we are at a crossroad where it would be easy to stay comfortable and avoid pain) lends access toward achieving things you never thought possible because you are afraid or too lazy.  He shows you that taking the hard path forces you to get at the core of who you are.  Facing challenges (however small they may be) creates mental callouses so that those \"difficult things\" become easier as you perfect the person that is YOU.",

He is out to impress no one but himself!!  He is true to himself before anything else, and his excellence in character shines.",

David's cussing isn't excessive, and it's in total character with his life story and his EXTREME experiences.  Language is a way to express our emotions.  Cuss words exist as a way to express extreme feeling or emotion while it also increases tolerance to pain.  Such words elicit attention and reaction from the listener toward the speaker's feelings about something.  So do not ignore this great story about David and the lessons learned just because he uses cuss words - it will be your loss if you do.",

Toughness is something you are.  It could be something you might not have worked very hard to get.  Callouses are something you have to actively develop.  He suggests a way to get there is thru getting physical callouses, i.e. exercising/working- hard.  After getting physical callouses, you can work on getting mental callouses and transform yourself past your 40% mental limit.",

I know several reviewers didn‚Äôt like how he repeatedly mentioned suffering or talking intensely at one self. But I can relate to that mentality a bit. On tougher runs I get tough on myself, if I‚Äôm on a long run or bike ride and I‚Äôm feeling the pain and boredom, I got to give myself a kick in the ass. Reading how he used his own techniques in highly difficult situations was awe inspiring and fascinating to learn about.",
