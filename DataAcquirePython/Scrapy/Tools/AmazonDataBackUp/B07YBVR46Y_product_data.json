I am pretty sure that it was because I store the bottles upright for a few weeks instead of storing on their side.  Needless to say, I needed to extract the cork and only had the old style cork screw.  I decided that I really needed this type of corkscrew to ease the cork removal.  This product is well made, appears very durable and I was loving it from the first cork.  Wine is one of my passions so a good quality cork screw is a must.  This one fits my needs perfectly.  Highly recommend!",

Found a good wing corkscrew, which finally \"bought the ranch\". Needed a replacement.  Couldn't find the exact model I had. What to do? Went to Amazon (of course). Found a variety of wing corkscrews. Which one to choose?  Decided on this one. Looked well-designed (it is). And, comes nicely packaged. Got it home, tried it, and am happy with the purchase. NOTE: I do need to add this. The screw part of this (or any) corkscrew is REALLY sharp. Be careful using it. Keep it in a child-proof drawer or shelf. Enough said. Enjoy!",
