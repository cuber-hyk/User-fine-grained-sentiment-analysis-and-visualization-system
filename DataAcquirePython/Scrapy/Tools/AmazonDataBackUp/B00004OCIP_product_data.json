Most of the criticisms were that it was too sharp and some people got cut.  I had cut myself with my old one so that did not really scare me.  I am really glad that I purchased this brand.

Is Zyliss better?  Probably.  And I'll tell you why...  The shape of a Zyliss is good, yes.  The price versus this and the swivel of the blade is stiffer, and the handle is medium compared to this which is large...  The blade is much sharper on the OXO.  Like it's going to cut you if you misuse it.  I like my Zyliss but when it's in the dishwasher I needed another one and this was cheaper...  huge handle, and OXO makes quality kitchen ware anyways.  OXO is right there with Zyliss on quality in my opinion. And the difference in cost, only time will tell which one wins but if you like a stiff peeler Zyliss.  If you like alot of action in the swivel, you have hands that can hold a larger tool, or you need a thinner slice maybe for fruits? OXO.",
