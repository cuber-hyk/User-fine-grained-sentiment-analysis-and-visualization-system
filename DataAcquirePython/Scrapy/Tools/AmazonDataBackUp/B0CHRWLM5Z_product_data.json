Measurement with the oven bimetal thermometer at this setting showed that the new machine reached the desired temperature, and my instant read digital thermocouple probe meter showed the highest (instant) reading at 174 F, while the old machine barely reached 155 F at this setting.

I have made cookies from the pulp if my hazelnut milk. I have made apple chips and kale chips. I have dried herbs and mushrooms we couldn’t use before they were going to go bad. I have made gf crackers and nut flours and sourdough bread crumbs from a stale loaf. Next up jerky and fruit leathers - over all, this thing RULES!",

    "content": "I got this wanting to dehydrate fruits and veggies and fruit leather for me and my kids and it just arrived today. Immediately out the box i was able to plug and play without reading anything. Upon reading the manual, it said to run it on 165 for 30 minutes with nothing inside and was able to find out that it doesnt get hot to the touch, it’s warm and can be placed on the counter without worrying about too much heat output. It’s extremely quiet. I was worried because some people said it was a little noisy and it’s no louder than a gentle fan sound like the one i use in my bedroom. It’s like very subtle white noise, not like a loud fan noise - it’s very quiet. I love the overheat safety auto turn off too just in case i need to run it through the night. I had 4 apples on hand and decided to have a go at making apple chips. I love that it came with a little recipe booklet too for some simple recipes to try out first. It showed me how hot and how long to cook the apples for. The 4 apples i had filled up all 6 trays! So many chips for only a few apples! Beats prepackaged apple chip costs by a landslide and makes a ton. I love it already. My only sad note to this was it arrived with a decent dent on the shell. Purely cosmetic but a bummer nonetheless. I decided to keep it though and not replace it but this isnt the brand’s fault at all, just mishandled by amazon/carrier. With that being said, in impressed at how sturdy it is because the dent doesnt affect the functionality at all.",

    "content": "I got this for Christmas 2022 and love it.  I would get this one again if I had to do it over.  I originally had the large Excalibur but decided I didn't like all the plastic and the resulting flimsiness (damaged in shipping) so exchanged it for this one (the 10-tray) and like having the metal much better.  Pros:  1)  Very generous drying capacity, which comes in handy during harvest time.  2)  Temperature control and range - I don't know that I will ever need down to the degree, but every 5 degrees is great, and I can do everything from delicate herbs to jerky if I want.  3)  The air circulation system does seem to dehydrate better than the circular Oster model I was given just to see if I liked dehydrating.  4)  The glass door is nice to keep a general eye on progress.  Cons:  1)  The trays are fairly close together, which may restrict airflow somewhat, so I start out loading every other tray but typically wind up using most or all of the trays.  I also try to skip completely the top and bottom trays due to their proximity to the top and bottom of the interior.  2)  It only came with one fruit roll sheet and one mesh tray - both hard plastic.  The hard plastic fruit roll sheet is great to put under the lowest tray to catch drips and bits and pieces.  I've never used the hard plastic mesh tray yet.  I did order and love the flexible silicone mesh mats and fruit trays.  The flexibility of these makes getting dehydrated foods off of them much easier, and they wash up fairly easily.  3)  It certainly isn't cheap, especially after you add on the cost of buying the extra mesh and fruit roll sheets.  I love this dehydrator, but it's a significant investment; I suggest if you are new to dehydrating, see if you can borrow or find a basic, small dehydrator to find out if dehydrating is useful and something you want to continue doing.  I started out with a $40 Oster basic model without hardly any bells and whistles but was able to determine investing in a really nice dehydrator would be worthwhile for me.  Things to consider generally:  1)  This sucker takes up a LOT of room!  It was way too big to fit on our kitchen countertop and under the upper cabinets with enough clearance for airflow, which is important.  We wound up putting it on a large, sturdy stainless steel utility cart (and up on bricks to give clearance for the dehydrator door to open) I purchased years ago from Sam's Club for my office (I think it's still available).  2)  It will put out some heat (welcome in the winter but not so much in the summer, lol, as we don't do air co) and doesn't run completely silent (but not bad).  3)  Think about how much drying space you realistically need in a dehydrator.  There's a 6-tray model that you should look at if you don't need quite as much.  4)  You will probably need to condition whatever you dehydrate.  It's a process, and you need to educate yourself on how to do this safely!  5)  Think about other food preservation methods (e.g., water bath or pressure canning) and how long you need your food to stay good in storage and how you would use dehydrated foods  6)  Join a FB dehydrating group or two for education, great tips, recipes, and community feeling.  I have a favorite page that I rely heavily on.  Happy dehydrating!",

My reason for wanting one is that I soak and dry all nuts before eating, but using an oven presented so many problems. I imagined that would be the extent of my use, but it is so easy to use I look for excuses to dehydrate whatever is at hand. Bananas, strawberries, & pineapple all turned out perfect. I tried several trays of garlic not all cloves dried to a crisp, but the ones that did I ground into garlic powder. I tried the no sugar jerky recipe with flank steak and thought it was good for a first time attempt.",
