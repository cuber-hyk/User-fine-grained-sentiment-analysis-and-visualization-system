I used it for 2 days to steam all of my clothes on a business trip and it didn't run out of water! It takes a few minutes to warm up, but no longer than a household steamer does.

Unless the fabric is very thin like a silk, rayon, or a polyester, it will not remove wrinkles. And it really takes quite a bit of time, requiring you to go over the fabric multiple times. Will not do much for linen fabrics or any kind of thicker cotton.",

I use it on my linen clothing, cotton clothing, satin/silky materials etc.  So much better than a regular iron and very lightweight.  Great for packing for vacation.",

It’s a lot faster than a conventional iron, and was safe to use on delicate wedding clothing, regular cotton shirts, 100% polyester tops, and fabric blends.  It heats distilled water up to steam quickly, and wasn’t overly heavy to hold up while steaming something on a hanger.  The tailor at the wedding suit rental shop said they all use them because they do a great job and do it a lot faster than the iron.  They don’t accidentally iron in wrinkles around armholes or pleats like irons do, also.",

I used it on other dresses and other things just don’t get it exactly, close on the item if it’s a colored item like a dark maroon because it will move onto the brush and then if you use it on a lighter color, it will bleed onto that. That is only issue that I had but it does work. I use it on my granddaughters little dresses and it seemed those perfectly , so yes, I would recommend this better than a iron",

It works fine for casual tops but I wouldn't use it for something that I wanted to look beautifully pressed (will turn to my iron for that). Very easy to operate; gives out a fair amount of steam (though some water sprays out on the fabric sometimes); you do need to move it up & down in order to smooth out major wrinkles and after 3 shirts, the water was nearly gone. I'd hoped it would be faster than using an iron - but it's not. It'll just be handy for a quick steam without having to set up ironing board.",
