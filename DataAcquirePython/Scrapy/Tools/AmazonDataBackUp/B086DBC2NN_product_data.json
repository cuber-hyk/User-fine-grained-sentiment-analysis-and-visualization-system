Not only picks up the little specs I saw on the carpet like tiny little rips of paper, tiny little rocks/stones/sand, etc. but also picks up stuff I didn't even see or notice until I went to empty it into the garbage. Seems to pull dust and cat hair right out of the carpet. Besides working great, it also did not scare my cat like the regular vacuum does, which is a huge plus because it breaks my heart everytime I need to use the regular vacuum and my cat gets all low and scurries into the bedroom to hide under the bed all scared.

I check to be sure the handle is secure before I begin using it and, so far, only once have I needed to tighten one section of the handle just a little bit. It does a good job. Of course, not as good as a vacuum cleaner, which I was aware of when I ordered this item, but my carpets look clean after I use my carpet sweeper. I still use the vacuum cleaner, but not as often. This carpet sweeper makes cleaning easier. It's an easy gadget to use, and I recommend it.",

I did, however, pay for a new item and received an open-box item. The item was shipped in a Tyvek mailer, the box container the sweeper was open, the bag with the handle parts had been ripped open, and the parts of the handle had spilled out into the mailer. The sweeper itself appeared unused and works fine.",

    "content": "I ordered this Yorcada carpet sweeper as well as the Fuller Bursh carpet sweeper. Thie Yorcada weeper was 1/3 the price of the Fuller Brush. I compared the internal construction, quality of the parts, ability to pick up on a short weave carpet that we have as well as on ceramic tile. Neither sweeper was designed to pick up on hard floors such as ceramic tile. BOTH sweepers had IDENTICAL internal construction and parts. The fuller Brush sweeper was a little smaller than the Yorcada. The fuller Brush seemed to have trouble picking anything up on our short weave carpet whereas the Yorcada picked up everything. PLUS the Yorcada even picked up food particles and other loose small bits on the ceramic tile. The Yorcada has a little more inconvenient mechanism for opening the collection bins on the sweeper bottom. But once you figure it out it's not a big deal. I have been using the Yorcada every other day or so now for about 3 weeks and it works great. I returned the expensive Fuller Brush one. I am a retired man with a disabled wife and I do all the chores. I am very pleased with the Yorcada.",

So well, that the small front and back rollers (they pick up hair, not dirt) hold onto the cat hair so well it is nearly impossible to get it off again.  The large middle roller does a good job of picking up small bits of dirt and debris.  Warning, it picks debris up only moving in one direction, not the reverse direction.",

This one is definitely not as sturdy (or as heavy) as the metal one that my mother had decades ago, but it does the job.  I am fostering four timid cats who leave fur, bits of dry food, carpet tufts from the scratching post, and general dust on the carpet.  A vacuum cleaner would frighten them, and those expensive vacuum cleaner bags would fill quickly.  This sweeper gets it, without electricity or vacuum cleaner bags, and the dust collection bins are easy to empty.  I am very pleased with this purchase.",

Easy to assemble, picks up bits the first time, definitely accomplishing the task.  The downfall is, this feels chintzy and steering is a drag because the handle wants to come unscrewed all the time.  It's handier to lift and reposition, rather than try to steer via the handle.  8/10 would buy again unless I was too sorely tempted by the more solid feel and increased steering action of a name-brand sweeper.",
