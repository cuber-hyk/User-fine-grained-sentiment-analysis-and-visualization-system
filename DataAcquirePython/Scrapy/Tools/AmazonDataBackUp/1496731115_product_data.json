I am a thriller and suspense lover so at first I wasn't too interested in this story thinking it was focusing on romance. However, as it built over the first 50 pages, I started to become attracted. I was pulled in by the mystery behind what really happened to Melanie. Nothing is ever as it seems. I really appreciated how the author built the suspense around the characters and the drama being unpacked. Thrillers are not for the weak so if you are triggered by cursing, drugs, violence, etc. This book is not for you.",

    "content": "\"The Wife Before,\" by Shanora Williams, is a thrilling whodunnit that involves Roland, a wealthy professional golfer, his dead first wife Melanie, and his current wife Mira, whom he met while she was waitressing at a high-society social function.  Mira doesn't keep up with golf and didn't even recognize the man who came to her rescue when she dropped a tray full of champagne glasses and cut herself in the process. But she feels a definite attraction and is delighted when he calls to ask her out.  Mira's brother Kell freaks out when he hears who his sister is dating, as he believes, along with many in the court of public opinion, that Roland killed his first wife, despite her death having been ruled as the result of a sensational car crash over a cliff.  Despite her brother's misgivings, Mira elopes with Roland and moves from Miami to his vast, isolated estate and mansion in Colorado. Things are fine until Mira discovers a set of journals written by the deceased Melanie.  They paint a grim picture of Roland's temper and jealousy.  Melanie's sister Miley and Roland's cousin/caddy Dylan add to the dysfunctional mix.  Melanie has plenty of her own secrets from the past, which come back to haunt her. Author Williams's use of excerpts from Melanie's journals as Mira is reading them really made the book exciting.  Mira can't read them all at once, because she doesn't want to let anyone catch her reading them.  That draws out the suspense. Mira is shocked to learn that Melanie had an affair and admitted it to an enraged Roland.  By the book's end, readers will know who killed Melanie and why.  Was it Roland?",

I agree with another review on Amazon that compared it to a mixture of OJ Simpson and Tiger Woods, though I felt like it was a combination of Tiger Woods and the novel, “Rebecca”.",

To be honest, I felt like it had a slow start for any action to begin. I feel like it started to pick up after Kell told Samira to stay away from Roland. From there, I couldn't put the book down. What a crazy turn amd twists of events this story took all of a sudden after Samira found and read Melanie's journals. I thought the story was going to end once Calvin got what he deserved but it absolutely was not. However, I'm so happy what happened to Dylan at the end. It left me wondering how it happened if it really was him who ended his life. This book is a 5 out of 5 for me! Woohoo!!",

    "content": "I credit the author having created a solid plot. The ending was not predictable as it is in many other thriller-style novels and it had a lot of potential. However, the character base completely ruined everything good that was going for this book. The main protagonist is a self-proclaimed freeloader who is equal parts delusional and empty headed. Admits to having no work ethic and relying on brother for financial support well past early adulthood. Is put out when finally, yes finally, she is “cut off” financially so the brother can support his own growing family, and instead of making something of herself, the lead role works a single shift to scrape money to cover utilities (since unashamedly, she won’t hold a steady job, so her roommate/friend pays all other bills) and doing so just happens to catch the eye of an incredibly wealthy athlete whom she proceeds to promptly marry, despite knowing he may be a murderer? What a win for woman kind. And notice how I said won’t hold a job.  Not “can’t”, the lead character lacks any sense of direction, purpose, or work ethic and is quite content having everyone else pay the bills. Then the counterpart is also incredibly self-centered and selfish female lead. You later learn there is past trauma that supposedly influenced the latter’s every life decision but even then, it’s just so incredibly difficult to get into. Throughout I became increasingly frustrated with the every single decision the key female leads made. Its just so incredibly unrealistic and in many cases irrational. Again, the overall plot was good, just so painfully weak in character composition.",

I couldn't stop reading it. The storyline, the plot, everything about this book captured my attention and did not let it go until I knew the truth. This book is definitely worth the read. I've been sleeping on this author and I regret it. Now to see what other captivating books she's written! Read this one y'all! It's definitely worth it. It'll keep you guessing to the very end!
