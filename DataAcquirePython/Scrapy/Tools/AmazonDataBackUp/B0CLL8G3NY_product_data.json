    "content": "Bought these to declutter the shower and boy did it work! These Caddies keep the bottles from falling onto the floor. They work well even if you have bottles with pumps they hold strong to the wall. Not only are they functionable but they look astatically pleasing as well. This product is very easy to install as well! The color matches our bathroom perfectly! These are great for those who need to keep clutter down while looking good!",

The other day the customer service reached out to me via email and wanted to know how I liked it and if it was damaged or any rust or anything . I let them know that there was a little rust and they offered me a full refund or a replacement. I choose the replacement because I love it so much . I recieved it in the mail yesterday and let them know . They are very fast to respond as well I highly recommend",
